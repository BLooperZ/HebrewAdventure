"3","145","Let us hope that your sheath does not turn out to be your shroud.","",""
"3","146","I told you - I didn't see a thing.","",""
"3","147","So! Be warned that I, Augustin Rosso, never rest until I reach the truth.","",""

"8","65","Thanks for the advice...","",""

"25","393","How did the Templars get their name?","",""

"25","395","The King of Jerusalem gave them part of a mosque on the Temple Mount.","",""
"25","396","It was said to have been the site of the original Temple of Solomon.","",""

"25","399","e","",""
"25","400","How come the Templars became so wealthy?","",""
"25","401","There was a constant stream of new recruits to their ranks, many from noble families.","",""
"25","402","They were required to swear a sacred oath of poverty, chastity and obedience.","",""
"25","403","So, their money, goods and land were donated to the order.","",""

"25","411","Or if it does, the truth has never been made public.","",""
"25","412","What do you mean by that?","",""
"25","413","The Templars have attained mythological status, like the King Arthur of the Britons.","",""

"25","416","No, not for a minute.","",""

"25","420","Mostly because he wanted to get his hands on their treasure.","",""
"25","421","He had an enormous debt and a life-long war with England to fund...","",""
"25","422","The trouble was, the Templars were a highly respected holy order.","",""
"25","423","If the Templars were so powerful, how did this Philip dude wipe them out?","",""
"25","424","By underhanded, dishonorable means, of course.","",""
"25","425","The Pope was Clement the Fifth, a Frenchman.","",""
"25","426","e","",""
"25","427","Fate had nothing to do with it.","",""
"25","428","He was Philip's puppet, planted to further his political ambitions.","",""
"25","429","Philip wanted the wealth of the Templars and used Clement to get it.","",""
"25","430","What was Philip's plan? What happened...?","",""
"25","431","Sealed orders were sent out all over France, not to be opened until the appointed day.","",""
"25","432","That day was Friday, July thirteenth.","",""
"25","433","That's the origin of our superstition regarding that date.","",""
"25","434","At dawn, throughout the whole of France, the Templars were arrested.","",""
"25","435","It was the biggest bust in the history of the world!","",""
"25","436","What happened to the Templars after their arrest?","",""
"25","437","Philip was out for blood, so he handed the Templars over to the Inquisition.","",""
"25","438","Not surprisingly, they confessed to a sensational and sordid list of blasphemies.","",""
"25","439","Like what?","",""
"25","440","Oh, the sort of things you read about in the gutter press...","",""
"25","441","Devil worship, lewd sexual practices, spitting on the Holy Cross - that kind of thing.","",""
"25","442","That must have given their lawyers some headaches!","",""
"25","443","Whether or not the accusations were true, this was not good publicity.","",""
"25","444","Most of the charges were probably cooked up, but so were the Templars - literally!","",""
"25","445","Hundreds of them were found guilty of heresy and flame-grilled at the stake.","",""
"25","446","They died protesting their innocence.","",""
"25","447","But surely Philip had no proof of his charges against the Templars?","",""
"25","448","A man will admit anything under torture.","",""
"25","449","The Inquisition fabricated some nonsensical demon called `Baphomet'...","",""
"25","450","...and then suggested to their victims that this was what they worshipped.","",""
"25","451","But they didn't have to agree!","",""
"25","452","The records show a Templar coming to trial with both feet burnt off...","",""
"25","453","...fragments of flesh and charred bone falling from the stumps.","",""
"25","454","e","",""
"25","455","So there was no truth at all in the Baphomet accusations.","",""
"25","456","Not a shred. Almost every victim described the idol differently.","",""
"25","457","No, Baphomet never existed outside the sick minds of the Inquisitors.","",""
"25","458","So Philip stole the Templars' riches, huh?","",""
"25","459","Oh, no! They weren't stupid!","",""
"25","460","The king's troops marched first on the Temple in Paris, then to the Templar home port, at La Rochelle.","",""
"25","461","There was no trace of the treasure, and the fleet of the Knights Templar had set sail.","",""
"25","462","Does the name Montfauçon mean anything to you?","",""
"25","463","Sure. It was the most grisly spectacle in Paris until the Revolution.","",""
"25","464","A public toilet?","",""
"25","465","Montfauçon was the place of execution for many thousands.","",""
"25","466","A dark temple of death, with row upon row of arches, each one framing a grim exhibit...","",""
"25","467","Scores of rotting corpses swung on creaking rope while the crows devoured their flesh...","",""
"25","468","That explains the image of the hanged man.","",""
"25","469","I found a reference to Montfauçon in Ireland, in a village called Lochmarne.","",""
"25","470","Lochmarne? That's where Peagram was digging!","",""
"25","471","That's right. He'd left the excavation before I arrived.","",""
"25","472","I've read about him.","",""
"25","473","Who's Peagram?","",""
"25","474","An eminent and popular English archaeologist.","",""
"25","475","His TV show took man's past into the top ratings!","",""
"25","476","Where was the site of Montfauçon?","",""
"25","477","To the north-east, near the Canal St. Martin, but there's nothing there now.","",""
"25","478","The old gibbet was torn down during the Revolution.","",""
"25","479","Do you know Peagram well?","",""
"25","480","Not really. I met him at a conference.","",""
"25","481","I would have liked to talk to him in depth, but I didn't have time.","",""
"25","482","When was this?","",""
"25","483","Oh, back in the summer... July, I think.","",""
"25","484","The second week of July?","",""
"25","485","Maybe... Yes, it was. Just before Bastille day.","",""
"25","486","So Peagram was in Paris at the same time as the other victims...","",""
"25","487","e","",""
"25","488","Nothing. Just thinking aloud.","",""
"25","489","Have you ever heard of the Hashshashin?","",""
"25","490","Why, yes. It was a radical Muslim sect whose name became synonymous with murder.","",""
"25","491","It was formed in eleventh century Persia, shortly before the Crusades.","",""
"25","492","At roughly the same time as the Templars...","",""
"25","493","Yes. They gave a new word to our language: Assassani - the Assassins.","",""
"25","494","How did the Assassins get their name?","",""
"25","495","From the legend surrounding the secrets of their initiation rites...","",""
"25","496","A young man who sought to join the sect was given hashish until he drifted into dreams.","",""
"25","497","He awoke to find himself in a fabulous garden, with everything he could wish for...","",""
"25","498","The freshest water, the most delicious food, the choicest hash and the most delectable women imaginable.","",""
"25","499","Cool. Do you have the address?","",""
"25","500","I haven't finished the story. There was a price to pay for this taste of paradise.","",""
"25","501","Wouldn't you just know it?","",""
"25","502","The young man would wake the next day to find himself back in the real world.","",""
"25","503","He was told that he'd been given a glimpse of the heaven reserved for holy martyrs.","",""
"25","504","A heaven he would enjoy for eternity - if he was willing to join the Hashshashin.","",""
"25","505","How did the Assassins operate?","",""
"25","506","Well, as I explained, the new recruits would be only too willing to die for the cause.","",""
"25","507","They'd be instructed in the use of the dagger, poisons and disguise.","",""
"25","508","Then, the Grand Master of the sect would name an enemy of Allah.","",""
"25","509","And they'd stop at nothing to eliminate that enemy...","",""
"25","510","You've got it. They were fearless - and deadly.","",""
"25","511","Does the cult of the Assassins still exist?","",""
"25","512","Take a look around at the world today. You tell me...","",""
"25","513","Thanks for your help, André...","",""

"56","119","...caused by a conjunction of the earth's natural power fields.","",""
"56","120","Hmm... Maybe not.","",""
"57","0","It was just about recognizable as the church I'd seen reflected in the chalice. ","",""
"57","1","Templars, Roundheads and Cavaliers. ","",""
"57","2","This place had seen a lot of history. ","",""
"57","3","A large arch led into the tower.  ","",""
"57","4","There were lots of graves, some as recent as late Victorian. ","",""
"57","5","It looked like the locals had carried on using this place as a cemetary...","",""
"57","6","...long after the destruction of the church. ","",""
"57","7","I figured Scotland had had enough trouble with Burke and Hare...","",""
"57","8","...without me trying my hand at grave robbing. ","",""
"57","9","The gate, like a lot of the church grounds, was in pretty good condition","",""
"57","10","I guess the locals tried to stop it getting too overgrown. ","",""
"57","11","No way were we leaving until the mystery was solved.","",""
"58","0","It was a simple cog arrangement with a handle to turn the larger wheel.","",""
"58","1","Without the handle the small cog and spindle were seemingly useless.","",""
"58","2","It was a support for the dismantled winding cog.","",""
"58","3","The handle turned easily and the larger wheel began to revolve...","",""
"58","4","Damn!","",""
"58","5","Then the handle came off in my hand. ","",""
"58","6","Now that the handle was gone it was easy to remove the cog and spindle.","",""
"58","7","There was no way of reconnecting the handle to the cog except by welding it.","",""
"58","8","There was no place I could attach the broken handle.","",""
"58","9","I placed the cog and spindle back in the supporting frame.","",""
"58","10","The wheel had a serrated edge which meshed with the turning cog.","",""
"58","11","Marks on the spindle behind the wheel suggested it once had a rope attached to it.","",""
"58","12","The wheel turned reluctantly with a creak of complaint.","",""
"58","13","There was no obvious way of removing the wheel from its housing.","",""
"58","14","The stone face of the demon grinned with a horribly life like expression.","",""
"58","15","It was so realistic, I could imagine the sculptor carving it from a live model.","",""
"58","16","That grinning face was beginning to unsettle my nerves.","",""
"58","17","With one of his eyes in place, the demon looked even more disturbing than before.","",""
"58","18","The demon's face was complete, and the effect chilled me to the bone.","",""
"58","19","The medieval world must have been a fearsome place to inspire nightmares like this.","",""
"58","20","The pipe helped a lot - he looked almost human - but I felt there was something lacking...","",""
"58","21","4","",""
"58","22","4","",""
"58","23","4","",""
"58","24","The nose was a great improvement, except that now he reminded me of my dentist...","",""
"58","25","Examining the demon more closely, I realized something about its face.","",""
"58","26","It was a clever illusion - no matter where I stood, the eyes weren't looking at me.","",""
"58","27","There was a simple reason: the demon didn't have any eyes.","",""
"58","28","I ran my fingers across the cold stone and probed the holes in the demon's eyes. ","",""
"58","29","Beneath them the mouth formed another hole - but I wasn't about to put my finger in there.","",""
"58","30","The cog turned freely, but nothing happened.","",""
"58","31","I tried turning the cogs but couldn't move them. I needed a mechanical advantage. ","",""
"58","32","I pushed the handle into the demon's mouth - the cogs all meshed. I began to turn...","",""
"58","33","The cog slipped neatly into the eye socket.","",""
"58","34","With a rasp of metal on stone I eased the second eye into place.","",""
"58","35","With the clay pipe in his mouth he looked happy, homely, like somebody's grand-daddy.","",""
"58","36","Sometimes the most childish gestures can have a cathartic effect...","",""
"58","37","The transformation of the demon to a clown did just that for me.","",""
"58","38","I pushed the pen top into the mouth and it disappeared somewhere inside the statue.","",""
"58","39","It had probably gone straight to biro hell.","",""
"58","40","I tried to insert my trusty manhole cover key in the mouth of the demon, but it didn't fit.","",""
"58","41","It was a heap of stones and stuff which had tumbled down from the rafters.","",""
"58","42","I scrabbled around in the rubble and found an old clay pipe with a broken stem.","",""
"58","43","Under one of the stones I found a metal coin which was green with age.","",""
"58","44","It was caked with soil, but what I'd found was a small cog and spindle.","",""
"58","45","With mounting excitement I felt something between my fingers.","",""
"58","46","It was short, hard and black, something I hadn't expected to find here...","",""
"58","47","It was a plastic pen top.","",""
"58","48","I didn't find anything.","",""
"58","49","Above the carved cross was an indecipherable inscription.","",""
"58","50","For all I knew it could have been scribed in Gaelic.","",""
"58","51","I tried pushing the panel but wasn't surprised when it failed to move.","",""
"59","0","As soon as I saw the flickering torches I realized the bogus Templars had beaten us to the Sword.","",""
"59","1","But where were they now, and why was it so quiet?","",""
"59","2","The torch burned with a sickly dim glow and a stench like fire and brimstone.","",""
"59","3","I really wasn't worried about the danger of igniting the gunpowder...","",""
"59","4","But Nico's temper was likely to flare up again. Now that scared me!","",""
"59","5","The powder spilling from the barrels reminded me of pirate stories I'd loved when I was a kid.","",""
"59","6","It was gunpowder.","",""
"59","7","It was definitely gunpowder, but it had solidified over the centuries it had lain here undisturbed.","",""
"59","8","Well, well!","",""
"59","9","If it isn't the great detective and his beautiful assistant.","",""
"59","10","It's going to be a pleasure killing the pair of you.","",""

"63","537","He was more like an older brother, really - always joking and laughing.","",""
"63","538","Papa always wanted I should study art. That's why I went to college.","",""
"63","539","Did you learn about photography at college?","",""
"63","540","God, no - I couldn't afford the materials.","",""
"63","541","We were billed for everything we used: paint, canvas, paper...","",""
"63","542","Most of my year turned to minimalism - it was cheaper.","",""
"63","543","I used to go poaching in the park for squirrel hair.","",""
"63","544","The only time I wasn't hungry was the term I did printing...","",""
"63","545","I used to eat the potatoes.","",""
"63","546","You're making fun of me, aren't you?","",""
"63","547","Oh, no!","",""

"63","557","They were the best times, warm and safe in their tiny cottage...","",""
"63","558","My grandfather rolled cigarettes while grandma made hot chocolate and cakes.","",""
"63","559","One day he stopped his rolling, put the lid back on his tobacco jar, and took me in his arms.","",""
"63","560","I laughed and wriggled, but he hushed me to be silent.","",""
"63","561","'","",""
"63","562","What did he say?","",""
"63","563","He said: 'I don't smoke, but she likes to think I do.'","",""
"63","564","What a weird old man!","",""
"63","565","Don't call my grandfather weird! He was the nicest guy ever!","",""
"63","566","I wish I was back in that cottage, instead of this crummy apartment in this noisy city...","",""
"63","567","Who was the guy you were supposed to meet?","",""
"63","568","His name was Plantard. I didn't know him, but he called me last night.","",""
"63","569","He said he had a story which would interest me.","",""

"63","571","I guess I'll never know what he wanted to tell me...","",""
"63","572","Not unless you have Rosso's gift for psychic interrogation.","",""
"63","573","How did Plantard get your name?","",""
"63","574","Through the newspaper - La Liberté.","",""
"63","575","I'd written an article linking two unsolved murders, one in Italy, the other in Japan.","",""
"63","576","The cases were remarkably similar...","",""
"63","577","...a wealthy victim, no apparent motive, and a costumed killer.","",""
"63","578","Plantard said he could supply me with more information.","",""
"63","579","Somehow, the clown must have known about our appointment!","",""
"63","580","I found Plantard's briefcase in the killer's hotel room.","",""
"63","581","It was empty, of course.","",""

"63","586","Why won't you tell me about this clown?","",""
"63","587","Why do you want to get involved?","",""
"63","588","Because he almost killed me! Isn't that reason enough?","",""
"63","589","I guess so. Listen...","",""
"63","590","I'll give you my phone number.","",""
"63","591","You help me with my story, and I'll let you in on what I know.","",""
"63","592","And let's get one thing straight right now...","",""

"63","596","Fine. I'll, uh... see you soon.","",""
"63","597","Tell me more about the clown's previous victims.","",""
"63","598","The first was Arno Bilotta, the millionaire pharmaceutical baron.","",""

"63","600","Imagine it! Millions of housewives, literally speeding their butts off!","",""
"63","601","Was he killed for his money?","",""
"63","602","No. He had no living relatives, and his fortune went to the orphanage where he'd grown up.","",""
"63","603","The only witness in the case was his Filipino au pair.","",""
"63","604","She swears he was lured to his death by a snowman.","",""
"63","605","What about the clown's second victim?","",""
"63","606","Yamada, the controversial Japanese Green politician.","",""
"63","607","He inherited his fortune from his father's electro-chemical consortium.","",""
"63","608","He was committed to dismantling Japan's automobile industry.","",""
"63","609","I can't see him gaining much support with a loony policy like that!","",""
"63","610","Yamada was a man of vision. He was years ahead of his time.","",""
"63","611","If you say so. How did he die?","",""
"63","612","At the hands - or should I say, flippers - of a giant Emperor Penguin.","",""
"63","613","A snowman, a penguin, and now a clown...","",""
"63","614","You know, I hate to admit it, but this is scary...","",""
"63","615","'","",""
"63","616","I don't blame you for being scared - I am too.","",""
"63","617","But this story could be my only chance of a big break...","",""

"63","619","'","",""
"63","620","Let's face it - we need help, George.","",""
"63","621","Someone who knows about these things...","",""
"63","622","Who do you suggest - Indiana Jones?","",""
"63","623","I know a guy who specializes in medieval studies.","",""
"63","624","His name is Lobineau.","",""
"63","625","Huh! Some stuffy old fossil who gets horny over ancient relics, I suppose.","",""
"63","626","Far from it. André isn't the stereotypical professor you have in mind.","",""
"63","627","Where can I find this Lobineau guy?","",""
"63","628","At the Crune museum. I'll give you the address.","",""
"63","629","Let's take another look at the manuscript...","",""
"63","630","What do you know about Professor Peagram?","",""
"63","631","I've seen his television program - Peagram's Past.","",""

"63","637","Yes. That's fine.","",""
"63","638","Maybe he'll make sense of the manuscript.","",""
"63","639","The guy at the museum identified the Knight's crest!","",""
"63","640","That's great news. I knew Lobineau would be likely to help. Tell me more...","",""
"63","641","It belongs to a Spanish family.","",""
"63","642","With Templar connections, no doubt?","",""
"63","643","That's one of the questions I want to ask them... if the family still exists.","",""
"63","644","Just how long have you known Lobineau?","",""
"63","645","André? We met at college.","",""
"63","646","He helped me out when I was a fresher - showed me round, that sort of thing.","",""
"63","647","You never told me that before!","",""
"63","648","I thought he was just a...a working acquaintance!","",""
"63","649","So he is. I rarely see him these days.","",""
"63","650","You know, he hasn't changed much - a little less hair at the front, perhaps.","",""
"63","651","I'd forgotten how much fun he could be.","",""
"63","652","Is there something going on between you and Lobineau?","",""
"63","653","What business is it of yours?","",""
"63","654","We agreed; all this - the Clown, the Templars - strictly business, remember?","",""
"63","655","Yeah, but...","",""
"63","656","So get off my case!","",""
"63","657","'","",""
"63","658","No, I haven't.","",""

"63","660","Research, George.","",""
"63","661","Yeah? You have a copy of the Clowns' Yearbook?","",""
"63","662","I have a telephone and a lot of contacts.","",""
"63","663","Oh. Well, did you find anything useful?","",""
"63","664","Not yet. I'm employing my first and most useful weapon...","",""
"63","665","What's that?","",""
"63","666","Patience.","",""
"63","667","I've heard of that. Isn't it a substitute for decisive thinking?","",""
"63","668","Have you found out any more about the murders?","",""
"63","669","Well, it may be nothing, but both the clown's victims visited Paris earlier this year...","",""
"63","670","When?","",""
"63","671","The second week of July. They were both here at the same time.","",""
"63","672","Did they meet?","",""
"63","673","I don't know, but I can't imagine it was coincidence.","",""
"63","674","Do you think the Assassin was responsible for killing Marquet?","",""
"63","675","I don't think so. He could have finished him off the first time.","",""
"63","676","Besides, Marquet would have recognized him.","",""
"63","677","He was pumped to the gills with sedatives.","",""
"63","678","He wouldn't have recognized the four horsemen of the Apocalypse unless they introduced themselves.","",""
"63","679","Have you ever heard of the Hashy-ashin?","",""
"63","680","No.","",""
"63","681","Marquet said that they were his biggest enemy.","",""
"63","682","His biggest enemy was the bogus doctor.","",""
"63","683","Don't remind me! That guy was evil.","",""

"63","774","I don't think it is. That's too obvious.","",""
