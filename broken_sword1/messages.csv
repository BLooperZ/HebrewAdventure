"0","13","It was hard to believe it was the same chalice. Now the light gleamed off its perfect surface.","",""
"0","14","Fifty bucks! In the States I'd have thought of it as a good night out. Here in Marib it represented hard currency.","",""
"0","15","It was Nico's photograph of the man we suspected of killing Plantard.","",""
"0","16","On the key ring was a big, old key that looked like it might fit the excavation door.","",""

"0","19","It was a short piece of wire, twisted into a rough circle.","",""
"0","20","It was a large blue gemstone.","",""
"0","21","The greasepaint had worked magic. Now it looked like aged marble instead of cheap plaster.","",""
"0","22","The stick I'd broken off was surprisingly hard and inflexible.","",""

"0","71","The keyring contained the keys to the washroom and the excavation.","",""
"0","72","It was the key to the excavation.","",""
"0","73","It was my plaster copy of the excavation key. Trouble was, it looked like plaster and it felt like plaster.","",""
"0","74","The plaster key had soaked up the paint nicely and now looked pretty convincing. Still felt like plaster, though.","",""
"0","75","It was the `Shake 'n Shock' buzzer I'd been given by the man in the costume shop.","",""
"0","76","The card read: Augustin Rosso, and gave an address to the south of the Montparnasse Cemetery.","",""

"0","78","The bar of soap had the imprint of a key in it.","",""
"0","79","I had filled the key's imprint in the soap with dry plaster.","",""
"0","80","It was a smooth, intricately carved piece of stone that had been concealed inside the great candle.","",""
"0","81","It was a short handled brush.","",""

"0","83","The mirror from Lopez's utility room. Yep, I was still looking great.","",""

"1","1","Paris in the Fall; the last months of the year and the end of the millennium.","",""
"1","2","The city holds many memories for me: of cafés, of music, of love... and of death.","",""
"1","3","As I picked myself up all I could hear was the ceaseless drone of traffic.","",""
"1","4","Life went on around me, but the explosion was to change my life forever...","",""
"1","5","The Sergeant was a scrawny man in his fifties who resembled a constipated chicken.","",""
"1","6","The girl presented a confident but sullen mask to the world, an expression more suited to the face of a delinquent youth.","",""
"1","7","Nicole struck me as being a typical Parisian woman: attractive, sensuous even, but with an alarming taste in clothes.","",""
"1","9","The leading article referred to the visit of a Nobel prize winner from some unprounceable Eastern European State.","",""
"1","10","That was the only news story: the rest was rumor, gossip and sensationalism.","",""
"1","11","Then I noticed the writing at the foot of the page...","",""
"1","12","It read: `Salah-eh Dinn, thirteen forty-five.'","",""
"1","13","The table had been overturned by the explosion.","",""
"1","15","It was an iron lamp post.","",""
"1","16","I considered climbing the lamp post, but it wasn't going to shed any light on the affair.","",""
"1","18","I contemplated crawling under the umbrella and pretending none of this had ever happened...","",""
"1","19","The blast had blown out the glass leaving a gaping hole.","",""

"1","21","I considered straightening the table, but I figured it best not to disturb the evidence.","",""
"1","22","The umbrella had protected me from the bomb blast, but it was of no use to me now.","",""
"1","23","Wrapped around the lamppost was a newspaper.","",""
"2","1","It was a stack of cardboard boxes which had once contained bottles of wine.","",""
"2","2","I examined the boxes closely. They were damp and smelly, and decidedly empty.","",""
"2","3","It was a plastic crate.","",""
"2","4","There was nothing of interest...","",""
"2","5","The drainpipe looked as if it would bear my weight...","",""
"2","6","The drainpipe hung limp and useless.","",""
"2","7","I took a deep breath and prepared to climb the drainpipe...","",""
"2","8","I guess the clown hadn't escaped over the rooftops.","",""
"2","9","I decided I'd had enough of messing with that drainpipe.","",""
"2","10","It was a battered old trash can...","",""
"2","11","I wondered what else lurked in the depths of that trash can...","",""
"2","12","It smelled like someone had dumped a truckload of fish in a locker room on a hot summer afternoon.","",""
"2","13","I'd had it with sticking my nose into French trash cans...","",""
"2","14","It was an iron cover concealing the entrance to a drain or sewer...","",""
"2","15","It was a heavy cast-iron cover.","",""
"2","16","I tried to lift the cover with my fingers, but couldn't gain any leverage.","",""
"2","17","The cover was too heavy and awkward to lift with my bare hands.","",""
"2","19","The window was protected by stout looking iron bars.","",""
"2","20","The bars didn't shift an inch.","",""
"2","21","I lifted the cover to reveal what smelt like the entrance to a sewer.","",""
"3","1","The pretty young waitress was unconscious.","",""
"3","2","The waitress was clearly suffering from shock...","",""
"3","3","It was the body of the old man.","",""
"3","4","It was hard to believe I'd seen him alive only minutes before...","",""
"3","5","The sight of the dead guy's staring eyes turned my knees to jelly...","",""
"3","6","I tried not to meet his stare as I searched the dead man's pockets.","",""
"3","7","No wallet, no papers, no credit cards. The guy's past was a blank page.","",""
"3","8","I checked his pockets. Nothing.","",""
"3","9","A mysteriously undamaged bottle of spirits stood on the bar.","",""
"3","11","Oh, my head. Never again!","",""
"3","12","How much vodka did I drink? No, don't tell me!","",""
"3","14","George Stobbart, ma'am!","",""
"3","15","Oh... American?","",""
"3","16","She asked the question quite innocently, but I could sense her reserve.","",""
"3","17","It was something which seemed to afflict all Europeans...","",""
"3","18","You look like you could use a little help...","",""
"3","19","I could use a little drink!","",""
"3","20","I feel sick, dizzy, and bruised - and I don't even remember the party!","",""
"3","21","Just relax and take it easy. You've been knocked out...","",""
"3","22","You don't say! What happened?","",""
"3","23","There's been an explosion. You should try not to move.","",""
"3","24","Are you a doctor?","",""
"3","27","Only one of the most brilliant medical minds on this planet.","",""
"3","28","He taught me everything I know about medicine.","",""
"3","29","No, but I used to play hospitals when I was a kid...","",""
"3","30","Can you remember anything at all?","",""
"3","31","Non. I need a drink. Pour me a brandy.","",""
"3","32","Is that straight, or with ice?","",""
"3","33","Just give me the bottle with a teat on it.","",""
"3","34","I guess a little drop won't hurt.","",""
"3","36","She knocked back the brandy as if it was water.","",""
"3","37","I was glad I wasn't picking up the check!","",""
"3","38","You could be in shock. No alcohol.","",""
"3","40","What about the old man - is he dead?","",""
"3","41","I think he might be.","",""
"3","42","Yes, he is.","",""
"3","43","Ah, mon Dieu!","",""
"3","45","That was different - she was family.","",""
"3","46","Has he... gone stiff?","",""
"3","47","I shouldn't think so. He's only been dead a few minutes.","",""
"3","48","Of course not.","",""
"3","49","I didn't want an hysterical French girl on my hands - at least, not right now...","",""
"3","50","I don't know. I haven't looked at him yet.","",""
"3","51","Some doctor! I am glad I am not one of your patients, m'sieur.","",""
"3","52","Perhaps you should...","",""
"3","53","She didn't respond. If I wanted another cappuccino, I'd have to serve myself.","",""
"3","54","Hey, wake up!","",""
"3","55","Hey!","",""
"3","56","Huh?","",""
"3","57","Do you remember what happened when the clown entered?","",""
"3","58","I remember that horrible tune he played all right!","",""
"3","59","It was like a funeral dirge!","",""
"3","60","I'd never liked accordion music, either.","",""
"3","61","Did the clown speak to the old man?","",""
"3","62","No - he just laughed at him.","",""
"3","64","Did the old man try to stop the clown?","",""
"3","65","Oh, he didn't have a chance.","",""
"3","67","That's it. That's all I can remember.","",""
"3","68","Did you see what the old man had in his briefcase?","",""
"3","69","No. He didn't open it.","",""
"3","70","What did the old man do when the clown snatched his briefcase?","",""
"3","71","Nothing. He just sat there, like he was frozen.","",""
"3","72","Did you know the old man?","",""
"3","73","No, m'sieur, I never saw him before.","",""
"3","74","How did the old man behave?","",""
"3","75","Well... agitated. He kept looking about him - at the door, at his watch...","",""
"3","76","As if he was waiting for someone?","",""
"3","77","Yes, I suppose so. He was worried about something, that's for sure.","",""
"3","78","If you ask me, he was having an affair.","",""
"3","79","He had that look about him... like a guilty husband.","",""
"3","81","I'm going to look around for evidence...","",""
"3","82","Did this newspaper belong to the old gentleman?","",""
"3","83","I don't know.","",""
"3","84","Someone has scribbled a note on it.","",""
"3","85","It reads: `Salah-ed-Din, thirteen forty-five.'","",""
"3","86","Does that mean anything to you?","",""
"3","87","Non, m'sieur, nothing.","",""
"3","88","About this newspaper...","",""
"3","89","I told you - it means nothing to me.","",""
"3","90","What a mess! This bombing is an outrage, is it not?","",""
"3","91","Stop that, m'sieur!","",""
"3","92","Stop holding your breath at once!","",""
"3","93","Has it occurred to you that he may be dead, Moue...?","",""
"3","94","Oui, m'sieur, but I prefer to look on the bright side...","",""
"3","95","Besides, I recall a case where the killer escaped by feigning death!","",""
"3","96","However, in this case the man is quite dead.","",""
"3","97","Clearly the killer knew of his presence and...","",""
"3","98","How many times have I warned you about premature extrapolation?","",""
"3","99","All we know is that he is dead.","",""
"3","100","It seemed reasonable to assume...","",""
"3","101","A great detective assumes nothing. Take Maigret for instance...","",""
"3","102","B... but he was a fictitious character, monsieur!","",""
"3","103","Why, he was no more real than... than Poirot or Tintin!","",""
"3","104","That's different, Moue - they were comedy Belgians.","",""
"3","105","Anyway, it is unlikely that even you will learn much from talking to the dead.","",""
"3","106","Examine the girl, and take her statement... if you can.","",""
"3","107","I doubt if she is in a fit state for questioning, m'sieur.","",""
"3","108","It smells to me as if she has been drinking!","",""
"3","109","As I feared. We have stumbled upon a den of iniquity, Moue.","",""
"3","110","Leave her to me, sir - I am used to handling drunken women.","",""
"3","112","Et maintenant, to business!","",""
"3","113","Your name, please?","",""
"3","114","George Stobbart. I'm from California.","",""
"3","116","Travel. I'm touring Europe.","",""
"3","117","You chose well. The city is most beautiful at this time of year, non?","",""
"3","118","Uh... yeah, I guess so - apart from the bomb blasts!","",""
"3","119","Were you in the vicinity of the café at the time of the explosion?","",""
"3","121","I was lucky I wasn't killed!","",""
"3","122","The Inspector passed over my remark with no reaction...","",""
"3","123","Did you see the deceased enter the café?","",""
"3","124","Yes, I did.","",""
"3","125","Was he alone?","",""
"3","126","Uh... yeah.","",""
"3","127","And did he say anything to you?","",""
"3","128","No. He was more interested in the waitress.","",""
"3","129","No.","",""
"3","130","Did you see anyone else in the café?","",""
"3","131","Yeah, there was a guy dressed as a clown.","",""
"3","132","He was carrying an accordion.","",""
"3","133","An accordion?","",""
"3","134","Bon. The picture is forming in my mind...","",""
"3","135","And it is not a pretty one!","",""
"3","136","I'm sorry, Inspector, I didn't.","",""
"3","137","It never ceases to amaze me how unobservant the public can be!","",""
"3","138","Is the girl all right, Moue?","",""
"3","139","She'll live...","",""
"3","140","If she survives the hangover.","",""
"3","141","She says the killer was disguised as a clown.","",""
"3","142","A circus clown? Did you see him, m'sieur?","",""
"3","143","Oh, yeah! Now you come to mention it, there WAS a clown.","",""
"3","144","I didn't think much of it at the time. After all, this is Paris...","",""
"3","145","I see you come well armored with preconception.","",""
"3","146","Let us hope that your sheath does not turn out to be your shroud.","",""
"3","147","I told you - I didn't see a thing.","",""
"3","148","So! Be warned that I, Augustin Rosso, never rest until I reach the truth.","",""
"3","149","You are my winkle, m'sieur, and I'm not afraid to use the pin.","",""
"3","150","She says the American claimed to be a doctor.","",""
"3","151","He forced her to drink the brandy...","",""
"3","152","I can explain everything!","",""
"3","153","Can you, m'sieur?","",""
"3","154","Almost everything.","",""
"3","155","She confirms the doctor's statement.","",""
"3","156","Oui? You did not tell me you were a doctor, m'sieur.","",""
"3","157","Uh, no. That's right. I didn't think it was relevant.","",""
"3","158","She confirms the American's statement.","",""
"3","159","A clown with an accordion, no doubt an elaborate and eccentric disguise.","",""
"3","160","Very well.","",""
"3","161","She doesn't remember seeing a clown, m'sieur.","",""
"3","162","That's odd, don't you think, m'sieur?","",""
"3","163","Who am I to believe, I wonder?","",""
"3","164","Eh bien. I have heard enough.","",""
"3","165","What do you mean?","",""
"3","166","I am satisfied that you know nothing. You may leave.","",""
"3","167","I hope this little incident does not spoil the rest of your vacation...","",""
"3","168","Enjoy your vacation, Doctor Stobbart...","",""
"3","169","What about my personal safety? Can't you at least give me some advice?","",""
"3","170","What can I say? Stay alert, and look out for suspicious characters...","",""
"3","171","And don't cross the road until the little man shows green.","",""
"3","172","Great advice.","",""
"3","173","I honestly believe you are in no danger, m'sieur.","",""
"3","174","Should you remember anything of importance, please contact me.","",""
"3","175","My card...","",""
"3","176","Thanks.","",""
"3","177","That is all. You may go.","",""
"3","178","There's not much to go on, m'sieur...","",""
"3","179","On the surface, no. But what lurks inside the subconscious?","",""
"3","180","If the door can only be opened...","",""
"3","181","Are you serious, m'sieur? I thought your interest in psychic detection was purely academic...","",""
"3","182","Academic? You are about to witness a scientific breakthrough!","",""
"3","185","I needed a stiff drink, but I hated the taste of brandy.","",""
"3","186","What is your name, cheri?","",""
"3","187","Who is he?","",""
"3","188","Ah! That is better.","",""
"3","189","Then he grabbed the old guy's briefcase and ran out of the door.","",""
"3","190","The clown dropped his accordion and ran out of the door.","",""
"3","191","Stay here, madamoiselle.","",""
"3","192","I do not doubt that for one moment...","",""
"3","193","Yeah. I was sitting out on the sidewalk.","",""
"3","194","Okay - you're the doctor.","",""
"3","195","I've never seen a real live corpse before, except for grande-maman.","",""
"3","196","And what brings you to Paris, M'sieur Stobbart?","",""
"3","198","Yes, I am. I studied under Doctor Benton.","",""
"4","2","It was a huge and weighty looking engineers' telephone.","",""
"4","3","It was a tent made out of plastic sheeting.","",""
"4","4","There was nothing inside the tent except a large toolbox. ","",""
"4","5","It was a battered metal toolbox.","",""
"4","6","I found a T-shaped tool in the box. I didn't know what it was, but it looked useful...","",""
"4","7","I'd found just what I wanted - a tool for lifting manhole covers.","",""
"4","8","The toolbox didn't contain anything else I needed.","",""
"4","9","Set into the huge gate was a smaller access door.","",""
"4","10","The door was securely locked.","",""
"4","11","No reply. The old concierge must have been busy...","",""
"4","12","Don't touch that phone!","",""
"4","13","Sorry...","",""
"4","14","Hé! Clear off!","",""
"4","15","Hé, what did I tell you?","",""
"4","16","Don't touch!","",""
"4","17","Okay, already!","",""
"4","18","Hé, stop that! Get away from there!","",""
"4","19","What d'you think you're doing?","",""
"4","20","I was... admiring your toolbox.","",""
"4","21","Ah, oui? Had a good look, have you?","",""
"4","22","I'm warning you - if you touch it I'll crack your nut!","",""
"4","23","Okay! I get your point...","",""
"4","24","He hadn't heard me...","",""
"4","25","Hi.","",""
"4","26","You're the guy who gave me the tip, aren't you?","",""
"4","27","Huh?","",""
"4","28","The racehorse - Salah-eh Dinn.","",""
"4","29","Oh, yeah. But...","",""
"4","30","I put every franc I had on that horse.","",""
"4","31","Listen, I...","",""
"4","32","My life-time savings, next month's rent - everything.","",""
"4","33","Oh, god.","",""
"4","34","She won by three lengths!","",""
"4","35","I'm a rich man!","",""
"4","36","Call me Lucky George, the punter's friend...","",""
"4","37","So how come you're still here?","",""
"4","38","Oh, I'm not going to let my new-found wealth change me, not one bit.","",""
"4","39","I've bought this hole, fittings and all.","",""
"4","40","Now I can come and go as I please.","",""
"4","41","No more clocking on or completion schedules...","",""
"4","42","No foreman breathing down my neck...","",""
"4","43","Thanks to you, I've found paradise.","",""
"4","45","Hey, you!","",""
"4","46","Hi! Can you spare a few minutes?","",""
"4","47","I thought you'd been arrested?","",""
"4","48","No. It was a misunderstanding.","",""
"4","49","When he pulled that gun - cah! - I thought that was it.","",""
"4","50","Those automatics pack quite a punch, you know.","",""
"4","51","He made a mistake. He thought I was a terrorist.","",""
"4","52","You? A terrorist? Ha!","",""
"4","53","He was only doing his duty, I guess.","",""
"4","54","What do you want now?","",""
"4","55","Did you see a clown come by this way?","",""
"4","56","A clown? Like in a circus?","",""
"4","57","Yeah. With make-up and a big red nose.","",""
"4","58","Ho! Those guys are funny, aren't they?","",""
"4","59","Not in my experience.","",""
"4","60","I love the circus - especially the horses.","",""
"4","64","You haven't answered my question.","",""
"4","65","Have you seen a clown?","",""
"4","66","You think I've got time to watch everyone who passes by?","",""
"4","67","Some of us have to work for a living.","",""
"4","68","Look, I know you're busy, but surely you'd have noticed a clown?","",""
"4","69","I told you already, I didn't see a thing!","",""
"4","70","He was wearing multicolored baggy trousers and make-up!","",""
"4","71","He'd be a poor sort of clown if he didn't...","",""
"4","72","Listen - I have to find that clown. He's a killer.","",""
"4","73","Why would I want to help the cops?","",""
"4","74","Community spirit. Together we can combat crime and stuff.","",""
"4","75","Say, who are you anyhow? A cop?","",""
"4","76","No, of course not. Do I look like a cop?","",""
"4","77","Non, but you act like one, sticking your nose in where it's not wanted...","",""
"4","78","I guess not.","",""
"4","79","How do you know this guy's a killer? Did you see him in action?","",""
"4","81","I wondered what that bang was...! Any bodies?","",""
"4","82","Yeah. An old man was killed.","",""
"4","83","Merde! I didn't think it was that serious. What about the waitress?","",""
"4","84","Oh, she's fine.","",""
"4","85","Thank the saints!","",""
"4","86","The clown killed the old man?","",""
"4","87","That's right. Blew him up with a bomb concealed in his squeeze-box.","",""

"8","1","The woman was doing something with a pair of needles that couldn't be described as knitting.","",""
"8","3","The door was shabby and in need of a coat of paint.","",""
"8","4","I couldn't imagine the Collard woman living here.","",""
"8","5","It was the door to Nico's apartment.","",""
"8","6","I pushed against the door, but it seemed to be locked.","",""
"8","7","Remembering the flower seller's advice, I pushed the door gently just above the lock...","",""
"8","8","They were lilies, or tulips - some kinda flowers, anyhow.","",""
"8","9","Pretty, I guess, if you like that sort of thing.","",""
"8","10","Me, I couldn't see the point of buying something that was already half-dead.","",""
"8","11","The last of the summer blooms on the flower stall were a reminder of the coming fall...","",""
"8","12","I inhaled deeply, expecting to experience the scent of the flowers. What I got was traffic fumes. ","",""
"8","13","The shop window featured a display of gowns and women's stuff.","",""
"8","14","It wasn't the style of the clothes in the shop that caught my eye but the prices.","",""
"8","15","The same amount of money would feed a starving family for the rest of their lives.","",""

"8","18","The vacant shop was sealed with a steel blind.","",""
"8","19","There was no way of lifting the securely locked blind.","",""
"8","20","It was a foodstore, selling fruit and vegetables.","",""

"8","22","Oh hi!","",""
"8","23","She didn't hear me...","",""

"8","27","I'm very good, and it only takes a minute!","",""
"8","28","Thanks all the same, but I'm not superstitious.","",""
"8","29","Besides, if it only takes a minute, that's not much of a future to look forward to...","",""
"8","32","Maybe not yet... but I see your paths entwined in the future.","",""
"8","33","I doubt it.","",""
"8","34","Hallo, my handsome friend.","",""
"8","35","I've changed my mind. Will you tell my fortune?","",""
"8","36","You're going on a long journey.","",""
"8","37","My, oh my. What a surprise.","",""
"8","38","Can you tell me anything I don't already know?","",""
"8","39","Ten francs please, my dear.","",""
"8","41","Please yourself.","",""
"8","42","How does this fortune telling routine work?","",""
"8","43","If I knew that I wouldn't be selling flowers for a living.","",""
"8","44","Haven't you ever wondered why you were blessed with the gift?","",""
"8","45","Well, it's a bit like satellite television I suppose.","",""
"8","46","Some of us are born with a built-in receiver dish.","",""
"8","47","I just happen to be one of the lucky ones.","",""
"8","48","Can you really foretell the future?","",""
"8","49","Only time will tell, m'sieur!","",""
"8","50","The strange thing is, I can't seem to see myself in the future.","",""
"8","51","Other people - I have no problem.","",""
"8","52","But when I try to see what might happen to me - nothing!","",""
"8","53","That must be scarey.","",""
"8","54","Maybe. I figure it's a kind of natural safety mechanism.","",""
"8","55","Either that, or I don't have a future.","",""
"8","56","Do you know a young woman called Nicole Collard?","",""
"8","57","Yes, I do!","",""
"8","58","She lives upstairs from me, in the apartment block across the street.","",""
"8","59","I tried the door, but it's locked.","",""
"8","60","You know, I've told the landlord about that a million times!","",""
"8","61","It is the damp. That whole building is like a sponge!","",""
"8","62","It sucks up the moisture from god knows where.","",""
"8","63","You mean the door is stuck because it's swollen?","",""
"8","64","That is correct. There is an art to opening it.","",""
"8","65","Don't shove it hard - just give it a gentle nudge above the lock!","",""
"8","66","Thanks for the advice...","",""
"8","67","The door isn't locked, but you'll need to give it a gentle nudge.","",""
"8","68","It sticks, you see - because of the damp.","",""
"8","69","The landlord said he'd fix it before winter sets in.","",""
"8","70","He's been saying that for three years.","",""
"8","71","How long has Mademoiselle Collard lived here?","",""
"8","72","A few months. She's in for a shock when the cold weather comes.","",""
"8","73","Drafty windows, insufficient heating - it's a struggle to keep warm.","",""
"8","74","The only reason I stay is because the rent is cheap.","",""
"8","75","Your young lady - she deserves better.","",""
"8","76","I thought Mademoiselle Collard was a successful photographer...","",""
"8","77","Not as successful as she makes out, for all her fine clothes.","",""
"8","78","Oh, I've heard her crying herself to sleep at night.","",""
"8","79","That's awful.","",""
"8","80","Now don't you let on that I've told you.","",""
"8","81","She's proud, that one - too proud, if you ask me.","",""
"8","82","Have you seen anyone out here, watching Mademoiselle Collard's apartment?","",""
"8","83","Yes, I have. A strange man, tall and thin as a broomstick.","",""
"8","84","He kept his face hidden, but I saw his eyes, peering from evil little slits.","",""
"8","85","How was he dressed?","",""
"8","86","A long brown raincoat, with a hat.","",""
"8","87","Like Humphrey Bogart?","",""
"8","88","Yes, but he didn't have Bogart's charisma.","",""
"8","89","Besides, this guy looked like he needed a toilet...","",""
"8","90","You never saw Bogart clenching his buttocks like that!","",""
"8","91","Are the flowers for sale?","",""
"8","92","Oui, msieur.","",""
"8","93","Okay, I'll take a bunch of those white ones.","",""
"8","94","I wouldn't do that if I was you.","",""
"8","95","No?","",""
"8","96","They are lilies, m'sieur.","",""
"8","97","Some people associate them with death...","",""
"8","98","Yikes! Thanks for telling me.","",""
"8","99","What other flowers do you have?","",""
"8","100","Dahlias?","",""
"8","101","What do they signify?","",""
"8","102","Insecurity.","",""
"8","103","Hmm. I don't want to give her the wrong idea about me...","",""
"8","104","What about the tall yellow ones?","",""
"8","105","Those are iris, the flame of passion!","",""
"8","106","And the little yellow ones?","",""
"8","107","Sensuality.","",""
"8","108","They're no use to me.","",""
"8","110","See you later...","",""
"8","111","That's right, m'sieur - you will!","",""
"8","112","Would you like to shake my hand?","",""
"8","113","No, I wouldn't. I can see the future, remember?","",""
"8","114","Can you tell me anything about this security pass?","",""
"8","115","I can tell it doesn't belong to you...","",""
"8","116","How come?","",""
"8","117","Give me some credit!","",""
"8","118","If you're an electrician, I'll eat my antirrhinums.","",""
"8","120","What do you think of my ball?","",""
"8","121","I'm picking up vibrations from it. That ball will travel far.","",""
"8","122","Do you recognise this nose?","",""
"8","123","Non, m'sieur.","",""
"8","124","What do you make of this tool?","",""
"8","125","Is it something a dentist would use?","",""
"8","126","No. It's for raising manhole covers.","",""
"8","127","Formidable!","",""
"8","128","Did I show you this tool?","",""
"8","129","Yes, my dear.","",""
"8","130","Do you know anything about medieval manuscripts?","",""

"8","134","There's no such place as the Club Alamut in Paris.","",""
"8","135","What can you tell me about this material?","",""
"8","136","It's a very expensive piece of cloth, m'sieur.","",""
"8","137","What can you tell me about this tissue?","",""
"8","138","Nothing.","",""
"8","139","Do you recognise the man in this photograph?","",""
"8","140","Ooh, what a hunk!","",""
"8","141","He's a killer.","",""
"8","142","I can see that. His eyes say it all.","",""
"8","143","No, dear.","",""
"8","144","What do you make of this gem?","",""
"8","146","A present for your girlfriend?","",""
"8","147","She's not my girlfriend.","",""
"8","148","Nonsense! You and her were made for each other.","",""
"8","149","Does this powder mean anything to you?","",""
"8","150","No, it doesn't.","",""
"8","151","Do you know what this tripod was used for?","",""
"8","152","I couldn't imagine.","",""
"8","153","What does this apparatus mean to you?","",""
"8","155","The doctor told me there was nothing to worry about.","",""
"8","156","I laughed in his face.","",""
"8","157","How come?","",""
"8","158","I can see the future, remember?","",""
"8","159","Don't remind me!","",""
"8","160","Does this lens mean anything to you?","",""
"8","161","No, it doesn't.","",""
"8","162","She was a cheery old soul, the kind you'd walk across the street to avoid.","",""
"8","163","The window was full of over-priced clothes for over-privileged women.","",""
"8","164","Ten francs? That's a rip off!","",""
"8","165","I want to make an impression, not jump down her throat...!","",""
"8","166","You are a remarkably talented lady.","",""

"8","170","The last time I saw one of those I was about to go to the operating theater...","",""
"9","1","The guys spoon-shaped face was mournful and humourless.","",""
"9","2","He looked like a vegetarian in a slaughter-house.","",""
"9","4","Boy! That caused so much of a stink you'd have thought it was a real one...","",""
"9","5","The plastic novelty was so damned realistic I could have sworn I could smell it...","",""

"9","28","I just need some information.","",""
"9","29","Of course. How can I help you?","",""
"9","30","Oui, m'sieur?","",""
"9","31","I'm looking for a man who hired a clown costume from you...","",""
"9","33","Two?","",""
"9","34","Yes - Bozo the clown and Seamus the Pixie.","",""
"9","35","What was his name?","",""
"9","36","Khan. A Middle-Eastern man, I would think.","",""
"9","37","And did he have the scar on his face?","",""
"9","38","That's right. In the shape of a crescent moon...","",""
"9","39","Oui, m'sieur? I do not see how I can help.","",""
"9","41","Of course, m'sieur, but....","",""
"9","42","Well, then - I'd like you to check your records.","",""
"9","43","Give me the names of everyone who has rented a clown suit.","",""
"9","44","Impossible! There are too many!","",""
"9","45","The clown I'm looking for is a cold-blooded killer.","",""
"9","46","Give me his name, and I'll see he's brought to justice.","",""
"9","47","I'd help you if I could, but you can't expect me to remember all my customers.","",""
"9","48","You see, the clown costume is our most popular line, m'sieur.","",""
"9","49","On average, we hire out more than thirty clown suits a week.","",""
"9","50","You'll have to give me more to go by. A description, per'aps?","",""
"9","51","How come clowns are so popular?","",""
"9","52","I think it has something to do with their unpredictable nature.","",""
"9","53","Personally, I think clowns should be banned, along with mimes.","",""
"9","54","Oh, come now - who doesn't love clowns?","",""
"9","55","Me, for one.","",""
"9","56","Have you heard of a man named Plantard?","",""
"9","57","I do not recall anyone of that name.","",""

"9","63","No - you keep it.","",""
"9","64","What would you give me for this ball?","",""
"9","65","Ten sous.","",""
"9","66","Oh. That's not much, is it?","",""
"9","67","It's not much of a ball.","",""
"9","68","Do you want this red nose back?","",""
"9","69","Not after it's been worn, thank you.","",""
"9","70","What does this tool mean to you?","",""
"9","71","Nothing, m'sieur.","",""

"9","83","Oui, m'sieur.","",""
"9","84","Do you recognize this man?","",""
"9","85","Ah, oui! He was here this morning.","",""
"9","86","He chose two costumes: Bozo the Clown, and Seamus the Pixie.","",""
"9","87","A pixie?","",""
"9","88","Very smart. Green silk with a taffeta lining.","",""

"9","104","Huh? Well... okay.","",""
"9","105","What are you trying to do - kill me?","",""
"9","106","You did not find it amusing?","",""
"9","108","Eh bien - it is yours to keep. A gift.","",""
"9","109","Do I need a license?","",""
"9","110","Non, but I give you a word of warning, m'sieur...","",""
"9","111","What?","",""
"9","112","Remember to switch it off before you visit the toilet.","",""
"9","113","It was a disgustingly realistic plastic novelty, like the one I'd left on the teacher's desk at school.","",""
"9","114","The dummy wore a traditional Pierrot costume. At least, I guess it was a dummy.","",""
"9","115","That man whose photograph you showed me - he hired two costumes!","",""
"9","116","Don't you keep a record of costumes that you've rented out?","",""

"11","415","Don't be too hard on yourself, Lady Piermont. You're wearing well.","",""
"11","416","I was referring to my family tree, darling.","",""

"11","423","Do you know what this is?","",""
"11","424","At a guess, I'd say it was a clown's nose.","",""
"11","425","That's right. It was worn as a disguise by a vicious killer.","",""
"11","427","That's him.","",""
"11","428","Good heavens! Are you trying to alarm me?","",""
"11","429","It's true. He uses the name Khan.","",""

"11","445","So - that deceitful little man is passing himself off as an electrician, is he?","",""
"11","446","Uh-huh. This guy probably has a million faces...","",""

"11","467","Thanks.","",""
"11","469","The clerk had given me a tightly rolled sheet of parchment.","",""

"11","471","This is what Moerlin was so keen to hide...","",""
"11","472","Really? All that fuss for a sample of wallpaper?","",""
"11","474","If I was you, I'd keep it well out of sight until you're clear of this place.","",""

"11","477","No, no - that won't do at all.","",""

"11","479","Thanks for helping me get the manuscript, Lady Piermont.","",""
"11","480","Anytime, my dear.","",""
"11","481","Can you think of any use for this tool, ma'am?","",""
"11","482","I can think of someone I'd like to use it on!","",""

"11","485","It might be useful to find out if that club is in Paris, George.","",""
"11","486","Would you care to shake my hand, ma'am?","",""
"11","487","Now, George - there's no need to be so formal.","",""
"11","490","Does the name on this card mean anything to you?","",""
"11","491","Augustin Rosso? No, dear - nothing.","",""
"11","492","It conjures up the image of a Gauloise-smoking, Absinthe-drinking French policeman.","",""
"11","493","I'm sure the real Inspector Rosso is nowhere near so romantic...","",""
"11","494","I think you'd be surprised.","",""
"11","495","Does this tissue mean anything to you?","",""
"11","496","Good god, no!","",""
"11","497","I just thought the smell might be familiar...","",""
"11","498","Please, darling - put it away.","",""
"11","499","I'm no shrinking violet, but that object makes me feel quite queasy!","",""
"11","500","Please, darling - not that again!","",""
"11","501","This is the key to room twenty-one...","",""
"11","502","That's next to the room taken by that rotten Moerlin, isn't it?","",""
"11","503","Yes, and it's vacant.","",""
"11","504","Really? How convenient...","",""
"11","505","Uh... yeah.","",""
"11","510","Do you want this key?","",""
"11","511","No, thank you, darling.","",""
"11","512","She had all the qualities of Bodicea, Elizabeth the First and Margaret Thatcher rolled into one...","",""

"11","515","No, not a real gorilla - it was a guy who LOOKED like a gorilla.","",""
"11","516","I'm looking for a man who dresses like a clown.","",""
"11","517","Uh... Like what?","",""
"11","518","Ah! Like monks, you mean? And they are involved in this case of yours?","",""
"11","519","If we had a ghost, Father Fécond would have flushed it out.","",""
"11","520","Not spécialement. The room is vacant.","",""
"11","521","Aw, forget it.","",""
"11","522","Oh. Well, this guy is dead, anyhow.","",""
"11","523","I don't know about that. Few of my ancestors were honest; not even to God.","",""
"11","524","Boy! Check my jewelry hasn't been stolen.","",""
"11","525","That gangster I told you about - he went through my pockets just now!","",""
"11","526","I'm only familiar with one person named Khan.","",""
"11","527","Ah! Moerlin, perchance?","",""
"11","528","I don't know what I would have done without you, Lady Piermont.","",""
"11","529","How satisfying. An Anglo-American alliance that actually worked!","",""
"11","530","It's some kind of manuscript, and it looks to be very old.","",""
"11","531","We met as tourists, and I want to keep it that way, despite the enormous social gulf between us.","",""
"11","532","I just couldn't bring myself to use the buzzer on this dear lady...","",""
"11","533","Maybe it was my imagination, but I had an uncomfortable feeling about this situation.","",""
"11","534","Excuse me - didn't I see your picture in the newspaper?","",""
"12","1","The sign on the door read twenty-one.","",""
"12","2","Maybe it wasn't the right room, but this was the right key...","",""
"12","3","The sign on the door read twenty-two.","",""
"12","4","If the tailor's description was correct, this was the killer's room.","",""
"12","5","The door was locked...","",""
"12","6","It wasn't the right key for the door...","",""
"12","7","Room number twenty-three...","",""
"13","1","A small cabinet stood beside the bed.","",""
"13","2","The cabinet was empty, but it smelt of onions. No kidding, it really did.","",""
"13","4","It was a massive mahogany wardrobe...","",""
"13","5","There was nothing in the wardrobe apart from a vague lingering smell of camphor.","",""
"13","6","The window looked out over a narrow alley surrounded by high walls.","",""
"14","1","I resisted a childish desire to toss things from a height.","",""
"14","2","I knew this was no way to treat an ancient manuscript.","",""
"14","3","I couldn't let it fall into the hands of the goons waiting outside, though.","",""
"14","5","The cobbles of the alleyway looked very distant and very hard.","",""
"14","6","If I wanted my shins sticking out of my shoulders, I could've jumped.","",""
"14","7","Mama Stobbart didn't raise no suicidal fools, though.","",""
"14","10","It was the rolled-up manuscript, waiting to be retrieved.","",""
"14","11","I figured it was best for me to return to the street before attempting to pick up the manuscript.","",""
"15","1","The bed was several times larger than the narrow cot I'd been given at the place I was staying.","",""
"15","2","The bed was freshly made, and the crisp white sheets told me nothing about the killer's habits....","",""
"15","3","It was the battered leather briefcase I'd seen Plantard carrying just before he died...","",""
"15","4","I searched the interior of the briefcase but, as I'd half expected, it was empty.","",""
"15","5","The cabinet had no drawers, just a single door.","",""
"15","6","The assassin had been too smart to leave incriminating evidence beside his bed...","",""
"15","7","The door led back into the hall.","",""
"15","8","I had the kind of feeling in my stomach that would usually send me running to the bathroom.","",""
"15","9","The pants were newly laundered and pressed with immaculate creases.","",""
"15","10","There was nothing in the pockets of the pants.","",""
"15","11","The pants matched the jacket which the killer had lost in Paris...","",""
"15","12","I couldn't believe my luck when I found two items in the pockets of the pants.","",""
"15","13","The first was an ordinary matchbook. No matches; no clues.","",""
"15","14","The second was a pass card which read: `Thomas Moerlin, Grüber Electronics Corporation'.","",""
"15","15","There was nothing else in the pockets of the killer's pants.","",""
"15","16","The closet was a solid, impressive piece of antique furniture.","",""
"15","17","The interior of the closet was large enough for me to climb right in...","",""
"15","18","The window didn't provide a very good view, but it gave me a means of escape...","",""
"16","1","The policeman was not much older than me. His face wore an expression of intense concentration.","",""
"16","2","It was Rosso's sidekick: Sergeant Moue.","",""
"16","3","It was a public telephone...","",""

"16","16","Huh? What for?","",""
"16","17","In the event of an accident.","",""

"16","20","Ah! Why did you not say!","",""
"16","21","Is Sergeant Moue available?","",""

"16","38","But - Sergeant Moue? He was so...","",""
"16","39","I know, I know.","",""
"16","40","He was as flexible as a riot baton, yet his heart was as warm as...","",""

"18","673","Dates back to the tenth century, you know.","",""
"18","674","Most of the existing building was added much later, of course.","",""
"18","675","Are the ruins open to the public?","",""
"18","676","Oh, no - it's much too dangerous.","",""
"18","677","Anyway there's nothing of interest remaining.","",""
"18","678","Peagram thought otherwise didn't he?","",""
"18","679","Ah, but it's not difficult to get them history boys excited is it?","",""
"18","680","Give them a bone to play with and they're happy as puppies.","",""
"18","681","Can you tell me about the tripod which was found at the castle?","",""
"18","682","Now there's a bone of contention and controversy.","",""
"18","683","It was dug up by an Englishman of the archaeological persuasion.","",""
"18","686","Who was this Englishman?","",""
"18","687","Professor Peagram. The same man who dug up the gem...","",""
"18","688","Was it Peagram who dug up the tripod at the castle?","",""
"18","689","The same man if he wasn't his twin brother.","",""
"18","690","And can you guess what he did with the tripod?","",""
"18","691","He sent it to a museum in Paris. I've seen it.","",""
"18","692","How can I get into the castle?","",""
"18","693","Those walls were built specifically to stop people getting in, Mr Stobbart.","",""
"18","694","But I dare say you'll find a way, if you've the will...","",""
"18","695","Listen, it's closed, locked, barred and bolted.","",""
"18","696","The castle is as impenetrable as the walls of Troy.","",""
"18","697","So I can't get in, then?","",""
"18","698","My, you're bright for a journalist!","",""
"18","699","Have you heard of the Phantom?","",""
"18","700","More than that - I've seen it!","",""
"18","701","And let me tell you - it's a dreadful spectacle!","",""
"18","702","So it's not just a local legend?","",""
"18","703","There really IS a Phantom of Lochmarne?","",""
"18","704","Oh, no.","",""
"18","705","I was talking about the Phantom of the Opera.","",""
"18","706","What can you tell me about the gem which Peagram found?","",""
"18","707","Now there is a gem which should never have been taken.","",""
"18","708","A man would have to be full of greed to covet that stone.","",""
"18","709","What's your interest in the jewel? You're not a reporter, are you?","",""
"18","710","Yes, that's right.","",""
"18","711","Another bloody news hound...! Well, you're wasting your time here, boy.","",""
"18","712","You'll find the people of Lochmarne are a tight-lipped and cautious lot.","",""
"18","713","Why? Have you got something to hide?","",""
"18","714","It's just that we don't like to wash our dirty laundry in public.","",""
"18","715","Oh, no.","",""
"18","716","Thank the lord for that.","",""
"18","717","The boy told me Fitzgerald was driven away in the car that hit him.","",""
"18","718","Maguire is always spinning wild yarns.","",""
"18","719","I don't know where he gets them from. Television, I expect, or comics.","",""
"18","720","If I was you, I'd take what he says with a generous pinch of salt.","",""
"18","721","Maguire's tale about the car sounds quite plausible to me.","",""
"18","722","He says the driver was dressed like a leprechaun!","",""
"18","723","That boy has a head full of fluffy toys!","",""
"18","725","You're too late to meet that fella.","",""
"18","726","Is he dead?","",""
"18","727","Not that - but he's gone from the village.","",""

"18","734","Haven't I made it clear enough to you?","",""
"18","735","I don't like parasites or things that crawl, and that includes journalists.","",""
"18","736","I'm sorry but I don't.","",""
"18","737","He upped anchor in the dark and shipped out before the dawn.","",""
"18","738","Why did he do that?","",""
"18","739","Who knows? A guilty conscience, or a secret assignation...","",""
"18","740","Whatever the reason he'll not be missed in Lochmarne.","",""
"18","741","Maybe now the fuss about the gem has died down we can get back to normal.","",""
"18","742","Why has Peagram's departure upset the landlord?","",""
"18","743","He's lost a paying guest, that's why.","",""
"18","744","More than that - there's the question of an unsettled bill.","",""
"18","745","Poor Michael's seen red over the business, and I don't blame him.","",""
"18","746","Well, why don't you ask him yourself, mister Ace-reporter?","",""
"18","747","Can you tell me more about the landlord?","",""
"18","748","Mick Leary? He's what you call a would-be sophisticate.","",""
"18","749","The trouble is, his idea of sophistication extends as far as putting paper in the lavatory.","",""
"18","750","I never worked out why he did dat.. It's much too dark in dere to read.","",""
"18","751","That's true. Have you ever run your hand over the back of the door?","",""
"18","752","The graffiti is written in braille.","",""
"18","753","What's your game? Keep your nose out of our business, mister!","",""

"18","762","I'm not telling you anything, mister.","",""

"18","782","Fitzgerald has troubles enough already.","",""

"18","791","Their financial empire stretched from the Atlantic to the Caspian Sea.","",""
"18","792","With bases in so many countries they had to establish new methods of fiscal transferal.","",""

"20","8","On the back of the cart was a crazily stacked tower of hay bales, leaning precariously against the castle wall.","",""

"20","23","So I see. What now?","",""
"20","24","He was totally engrossed in the book he was reading...","",""
"20","25","Good book?","",""
"20","26","A book? It's a passport to a world of fantasy and imagination...","",""
"20","27","Yeah? What's the title?","",""
"20","28","Creative shelving for beginners - the 1978 edition.","",""
"20","29","What's so cool about home improvement?","",""
"20","30","There's nothing like it.","",""
"20","31","The resinous autumnal aroma of seasoned wood, the rhythmic rasp of the plane...","",""
"20","32","Ah, no wonder Our Lord came to earth as the son of a humble carpenter.","",""
"20","33","I'll bet he was a wizard with a chisel and a length of two by four...","",""
"20","34","Surely the portrayal of Christ's adoptive family as humble artisans is a symbolic metaphor?","",""
"20","35","I don't know about that, but I know they were carpenters.","",""
"20","36","Haven't you read the book?","",""
"20","37","Well, no, but I saw `The Greatest Story Ever Told', and I don't recall Jesus putting up any shelves...","",""
"20","38","What can you tell me about the castle?","",""
"20","39","Not much, I'm sorry to say. Most of its history is long forgotten.","",""
"20","40","Ah, but if these old stones could only speak, what stories they'd tell...","",""
"20","41","Stories to make your toes curl and your blood run cold!","",""
"20","42","You know, this castle is said to be over six hundred years old!","",""
"20","43","Who built the castle?","",""
"20","44","Mad Phelan, the first lord of Lochmarne!","",""
"20","45","Well, I say lord, but actually he was little more than a village chieftain.","",""
"20","46","He built his castle from the remains of the Templar Preceptory.","",""
"20","47","Do you mind if I climb up your hay stack to get into the castle?","",""
"20","48","What? You'd break your stupid neck, for sure!","",""

"20","53","I caught a glimpse of a flash of red on the hill and heard the racket!","",""
"20","54","Sure it was an awful noise. A sports car, you say?","",""
"20","55","A Ferrari, to be exact.","",""
"20","56","A racing car? And what was it doing here?","",""
"20","57","The poor fella must have been lost!","",""
"20","58","The driver of the Ferrari was involved in an accident.","",""
"20","59","Is that so?","",""
"20","60","Yeah - he knocked somebody down outside the bar.","",""
"20","61","What an idiot! How could a thing like that happen?","",""
"20","62","He was traveling too fast.","",""
"20","63","So fast he ran right under the car?","",""
"20","64","I mean the car was traveling too fast.","",""
"20","65","But you'd have thought the idiot could have heard it coming!","",""
"20","66","Did you notice which way the car was traveling?","",""
"20","67","To hazard a guess I'd say it was forward.","",""
"20","68","But which direction did it leave the village?","",""
"20","69","East. Does it matter?","",""
"20","70","Sure it does. That's where the kidnapper has taken Sean.","",""
"20","71","Ah, ha - we've got him for sure, like a cornered rat!","",""
"20","72","That road leads to one place only - straight to Dublin.","",""
"20","73","Maybe you know the guy who was hit by the Ferrari?","",""
"20","74","His name is Sean Fitzgerald.","",""
"20","75","Oh, I know him all right.","",""
"20","76","That's my nephew - the idiot responsible for the stacking of my hay cart.","",""
"20","77","Was he killed by the car?","",""
"20","79","Well, that's a relief now.","",""
"20","80","Aren't you going to look for your nephew?","",""
"20","81","What for? From what you say, it's too late.","",""
"20","82","You could report the matter to the police.","",""
"20","83","Better not. Besides, what could they do?","",""
"20","85","They have only the one bicycle between them.","",""
"20","88","I'm not sure I want to know!","",""
"20","89","But you're his uncle, his own flesh and blood!","",""
"20","90","You're right, but what can I do?","",""
"20","91","If I'm not here to guard it, some idiot might try to climb the hay stack!","",""
"20","92","What a moral dilemma!","",""
"20","93","To stay here and guard this potentially lethal agricultural construction...","",""
"20","94","Or to go off in search of the prodigal nephew, the very man responsible for said hazard?","",""
"20","95","It'll need some thinkin' about.","",""
"20","96","Why, there's no problem.","",""
"20","97","You're right. Why didn't I think of it before?","",""
"20","98","We'll demolish the haystack.","",""
"20","99","You don't have to demolish the haystack to go look for Sean.","",""
"20","100","I'll stay here in your place and warn anyone who's silly enough to climb it...","",""
"20","101","Marvelous! I think I should start my enquiries in the bar...","",""
"20","102","He strode off in the direction of MacDevitts bar, leaving me to contemplate the stack of hay.","",""
"20","103","Have you heard of the Phantom of Lochmarne?","",""
"20","104","I have, and it's not true.","",""
"20","105","That's what I figured. You have to be pretty dumb to believe in ghosts.","",""
"20","106","Oh, I believe in ghosts - I just don't happen believe in this ghost.","",""
"20","108","No. He's packed up and gone.","",""
"20","109","Do you happen to know where?","",""
"20","111","Do you think Peagram's disappearance is due to the curse?","",""
"20","112","Look at the facts: he dug up the gem, he disappeared. Bingo!","",""
"20","113","It doesn't take a degree in mathematics to work that one out, does it?","",""
"20","114","You don't have to be a smarty Pythagorus with a calculator!","",""
"20","115","I guess not.","",""
"20","116","Peagram has run off with the gem!","",""
"20","117","Where was the site of the Templar preceptory?","",""
"20","118","Right here - on Temple hill.","",""
"20","119","Phelan built right on top of the old walls.","",""
"20","120","It's said that deep beneath these walls, there's a Templar chapel.","",""
"20","121","Did Peagram discover the chapel?","",""
"20","122","I don't know. His workers were sworn to secrecy.","",""
"20","123","Have you read about Peagram's discovery?","",""
"20","124","The gem? Oh, yes.","",""
"20","125","Did you get to see it?","",""
"20","126","No, he didn't show it to us.","",""
"20","127","Oh, nothing...","",""
"20","128","I have to go now.","",""
"20","130","Whatever gave you that idea? Oh dear, oh dear me, no.","",""
"20","131","Does this curiously twisted piece of wire mean anything to you?","",""
"20","132","Oh dear. Now what would you be wanting with a cruel snare like that?","",""
"20","133","It's not mine! It belongs to the old guy in the bar...","",""
"20","134","Ah, yes - it would.","",""
"20","135","Is this wire intended to be used as a snare?","",""
"20","136","That's right.","",""
"20","137","This is the gem that Peagram found in the castle...","",""
"20","138","So that's what all the fuss was about...","",""
"20","139","I can't see why, myself. Why men would fight and steal and kill over a little bauble like that.","",""
"20","140","It's kinda neat the way it sparkles...","",""
"20","141","And that's where it belongs!","",""
"20","142","Does this false nose mean anything to you?","",""
"20","143","You're a circus clown.","",""
"20","144","No, but I got this from someone who disguised himself as a clown.","",""
"20","145","Is that a fact? Why did he do that now?","",""
"20","146","He's a psychotic killer. I think he may be connected with Peagram's disappearance.","",""
"20","148","Yes, you did.","",""
"20","149","Do you recognize the man in this photograph?","",""
"20","150","No, but I wouldn't trust him. His eyes are too close together.","",""
"20","151","He's not a friend of yours, is he?","",""
"20","152","Oh, no. Far from it. In fact, I believe it's the face of a killer!","",""
"20","153","I knew it! Piggy eyes. Can't trust 'em.","",""
"20","154","I already told you I didn't.","",""
"20","155","Do you recognize the name on this card?","",""
"20","156","I can't read that little writing!","",""
"20","157","It says: `Thomas Moerlin, Grüber Electronics.'","",""
"20","158","Is that your name? Tommy Merlin?","",""
"20","159","No...","",""
"20","160","But what a great stage name! It had what my high-school hypnosis act had lacked: style and class!","",""
"20","161","For a few seconds I bathed in spot lights on a thundering tide of applause: Tommy Merlin, Hypnotist!","",""
"20","162","Are you all right?","",""
"20","163","I'm fine. I just remembered something...","",""
"20","164","About this pass...","",""
"20","165","You showed me before.","",""
"20","166","Does this tool mean anything to you?","",""
"20","167","No, it doesn't. Is it used on sheep?","",""
"20","168","No, its for lifting the covers off drains.","",""
"20","169","Never! How?","",""
"20","170","The end of the tool fits into a hole in the cover...","",""
"20","171","They'd slip out. Angle's all wrong... You'd never do it.","",""
"20","172","I have! I did it in Paris. ","",""
"20","173","You already showed me that, and I wasn't impressed. ","",""
"20","174","What do you make of this matchbook?","",""
"20","175","Seems ordinary enough to me.","",""
"20","176","What do you make of this tissue?","",""
"20","177","That's a sorry sight to wave about in public!","",""
"20","178","Oh, it's theatrical greasepaint.","",""
"20","179","And that makes it all right, does it?","",""
"20","180","I must remember that next time someone complains about the state of my handkerchief...","",""
"20","183","Would you like to shake my hand?","",""
"20","184","What is this? I don't do that male bonding stuff!","",""
"20","190","Come on - forget your prejudice and shake hands...","",""
"20","191","Never. It's not natural.","",""
"20","192","What do you think of my flashlight?","",""
"20","193","Those electric lamps are useful, but limited in lifespan, in my experience.","",""
"20","194","I was given one for my birthday, but it stopped working after a month.","",""
"20","195","The battery was probably drained.","",""
"20","196","What? Nobody told me! I threw it away!","",""
"20","197","Did I show you my flashlight?","",""
"20","198","Indeed you did.","",""
"20","199","Do you know anything about this piece of wire?","",""
"20","200","It looks like a hand made snare.","",""
"20","201","Have you any use for this towel?","",""
"20","202","Did I show you this nose?","",""
"20","203","I was a little out of practice...","",""
"20","204","No. But he has been abducted.","",""
"20","205","Well, they could mount a search!","",""
"20","206","In a question of superior acceleration, I'd put me money on the Ferrari...","",""
"20","207","I think you ought to know exactly what Sean has gotten himself into...","",""
"20","208","Have you seen Professor Peagram?","",""
"20","209","Back in England, I suppose.","",""
"21","1","The stack of hay stopped short of the top of the wall.","",""
"21","2","Even if I stretched as far as I could, the wall was out of reach.","",""
"21","3","What I needed was a slice or two of Alice's Wonderland...","",""
"21","4","There was a narrow crack between two of the stones where the centuries-old mortar had crumbled away.","",""
"21","6","I pushed my fingers into the narrow crack. It went back several inches into the rock.","",""
"21","10","Above my head was a gap in the wall where the massive stones had fallen away.","",""
"21","11","The lifting key was rammed tightly into the crack in the wall forming a strong foothold.","",""
"21","12","I tugged at the lifting key and found it was held quite securely.","",""
"21","14","It remained lodged in the wall, jutting out to form a step.","",""
"21","15","I inserted the end of the lifting key in the mortarless crack and gave it a firm shove.","",""
"22","1","The goat was tangled up with the old plow.","",""
"22","2","It was the fiercest, meanest looking old goat I'd ever laid eyes upon.","",""
"22","3","The goat's movements were restricted by a halter tied to a metal post.","",""
"22","4","The top of a ladder rose out of the squarely dug hole.","",""
"22","5","It was a rusted piece of iron, maybe part of a plow or something.","",""
"22","6","The rope by which the goat was tethered had become tangled on the old plow share...","",""
"22","7","No way was I going near that old goat!","",""
"22","8","Hey, Billy!","",""
"22","9","The animal fixed on me with an evil glare.","",""
"22","10","Behind the malice and resentment there was a cool intelligence.","",""
"22","11","How ya doing, boy?","",""
"22","12","I felt as threatened as I'd been by the assassin and his goons in Paris...","",""
"22","13","The goat responded with a cool and penetrating stare.","",""
"23","1","Behind the altar was a carved panel, decorated with animals, birds and plants.","",""
"23","2","A flight of stairs led down into darkness.","",""
"23","3","I tried in vain to move the panel...","",""
"23","4","There was a pattern of five holes arranged on the wall. They'd been drilled there deliberately.","",""
"23","5","The plaster replica was held against the wall by the pins slotted into the matching sockets.","",""
"23","6","The hardened plaster cast fitted snugly into the five matching sockets. There was a soft thud, then silence... ","",""
"23","7","I placed my fingers and thumb into the holes in the wall. Nothing happened.","",""
"23","8","The fragile replica was jammed into the sockets in the wall. I decided not to disturb it.","",""
"23","9","The faucet was old and rusty and probably hadn't been used for centuries.","",""
"23","10","The faucet turned reluctantly. There wasn't a drop of water in the pipe.","",""
"23","11","It was a statue which had fallen from its place on the wall.","",""
"23","12","Five fingers of stone projected from the back of the carving.","",""
"23","13","The statue lay face up in the soft sand.","",""
"23","14","The statue was too heavy to lift. It overbalanced into the sand...","",""
"23","15","As I swung the stone upright I noticed it had left a pattern of holes in the sand...","",""
"23","16","I swung the stone back to its original position.","",""
"23","17","The plaster cast was a pretty neat replica of the back of the stone, complete with protruding fingers.","",""
"23","18","I placed the fragile plaster cast back on the ground...","",""
"23","19","I eased the solid piece of plaster from the sand.","",""
"23","20","Underneath, it had formed a perfect copy of the statue.","",""
"23","21","The sack contained a fine white powder.","",""
"23","22","The sack was empty.","",""
"23","23","As I dipped my fingers into the soft white powder I realized what it was.","",""
"23","24","Plaster of Paris! I'd used it in kindergarten to make casts of animal paw prints.","",""
"23","25","I reached into the sack, but it was empty.","",""
"23","26","I squeezed the towel over the sack but I couldn't extract any moisture from it..","",""
"23","27","I watched the water soak into the powder. It didn't achieve anything.","",""
"23","28","The five fingers on the back of the statue had left their impressions in the fine sand.","",""
"23","29","The patch of sand where the statue had fallen was covered with a dense sprinkling of plaster.","",""
"23","30","My improvised plaster cast was slowly drying out...","",""
"23","31","A lump of hardened plaster lay on the sand at my feet.","",""
"23","32","I placed my fingers in the five impressions left by the fallen stone. It was weird - they fit perfectly...","",""
"23","33","I smoothed the plaster level with the sand. It was my first experience of home improvement...","",""
"23","34","The sand was wet and icky with damp plaster.","",""
"23","35","I sprinkled the plaster on the sand until the holes were filled.","",""
"23","36","The holes were already full of plaster","",""
"23","37","I squeezed every last drop of water out of the towel and watched it draining away in the sand.","",""
"23","38","The trickle of water was quickly absorbed by the plaster.","",""
"23","39","The trickle of water splashed onto the hardened plaster.","",""
"23","40","I squeezed the towel as hard as I could, but it was barely damp.","",""
"23","41","What the hell. There was no-one around, and I was bursting...","",""
"23","42","The bench had probably been used by Peagram and his archaeological team.","",""
"23","43","The only one object on the table which interested me was a small sack...","",""
"24","1","The tripod was definitely the one on the manuscript - the Templar connection confirmed it.","",""
"24","2","I was tempted to go to Ireland to check it out...","",""
"24","3","Through the grimy glass I could see several large shapes in a gloomy room.","",""
"24","4","What they were I couldn't imagine. ","",""
"24","5","I considered smashing my fist through the pane, wrenching open the window, and vaulting triumphantly into the building.","",""
"24","6","Then I thought - no, that's dumb. Besides, I might get hurt.","",""
"24","7","There was no obvious way into the building.","",""
"24","8","Access to the side and rear of the museum building was blocked by a dense clump of bushes.","",""
"24","9","A real macho guy would have plunged straight into the spiky, scratchy bushes - not me.","",""
"25","2","The attendant had an air of self importance and the kind of steely eyes that never seem to blink.","",""
"25","3","The case contained a collection of rocks.","",""
"25","4","There were all shapes and colors, but they were still rocks.","",""
"25","5","Above them a sign read `L'Age Paléolithique'.","",""
"25","6","I tried to sneak my hand inside while the guard wasn't looking, but the case was locked.","",""
"25","7","The case contained some fragments of pottery.","",""
"25","8","They looked to me like broken flower pots..","",""
"25","9","Above them a sign read `L'Age Paléolithique'.","",""
"25","10","I tried to sneak my hand inside while the guard wasn't looking, but the case was locked.","",""
"25","11","It was a statue from Ancient Egypt.","",""
"25","12","Those old civilisations sure could teach us a few things about art and beauty...","",""
"25","13","The statue didn't deserve to be mauled by a philistine like me...","",""
"25","14","A metal rod attached to the wall was connected to the window.","",""
"25","16","The rod turned smoothly and the window above me opened.","",""
"25","17","The case contained two rows of silver coins.","",""
"25","18","Each coin on the lower row showed a portrait of a guy with a huge nose.","",""
"25","19","I tried to raise the glass cover of the case, but it didn't budge.","",""
"25","20","I looked down at a collection of tools with wooden handles and tarnished metal blades.","",""
"25","21","There were knives, chisels and spikes fanned out in a semi-circle.","",""
"25","22","I guess there's always been a need for home improvement.","",""
"25","23","I tried to sneak my hand inside while the guard wasn't looking, but the case was locked.","",""
"25","24","There were several weird objects in the case, and I wasn't sure what any of them were.","",""
"25","25","A bundle of feathers, beads and bones tied together with strands of coarse hair...","",""
"25","26","A greenish stone carved with a five-pointed star...","",""
"25","27","I tried to sneak my hand inside while the guard wasn't looking, but the case was locked.","",""
"25","28","It was a large brass urn.","",""
"25","29","There was nothing in the urn.","",""
"25","30","It was a tapestry of a lady, a lion and a unicorn.","",""
"25","31","If I'd had more time I could have stared at it all day...","",""
"25","32","Touching an object as rare and beautiful as that would have been the act of a barbarian.","",""
"25","33","In the case was a spindly tripod, blackened with age and pitted with rust...","",""
"25","34","It was identical to the tripod pictured on the manuscript!","",""
"25","35","A notice identified it as fifteenth century, from Western Ireland.","",""
"25","36","It had been found in Lochmarne, at the site of a Knights Templar preceptory!","",""
"25","37","The case contained the tripod shown on the manuscript.","",""
"25","38","As I reached toward the display case a shrill piping filled the air.","",""
"25","39","I froze, then tried to get myself together and act nonchalantly.","",""
"25","40","The case was empty.","",""
"25","41","The glass case was intact, but the tripod had been replaced by a sign reading: `EXHIBIT TEMPORARILY REMOVED'.","",""
"25","42","The totem pole looked distinctly out of place in the setting of the museum.","",""
"25","44","It was a stone carving from Ancient Egypt.","",""
"25","45","I was no desecrator of tombs...","",""
"25","47","This is ridiculous! I could be here for hours!","",""
"25","48","High above me was a window.","",""
"25","49","He ignored me...","",""
"25","50","You've left it very late, m'sieur!","",""
"25","51","Late? For what?","",""
"25","52","Anything. I'm closing the museum soon.","",""
"25","53","You wouldn't like to get locked in, I can tell you. Not in this gallery.","",""
"25","54","Why not?","",""
"25","56","You don't believe in ghosts, surely?","",""
"25","57","Oh, yes I do! Seven years ago a lad managed to hide in here.","",""
"25","58","He'd made a bet with his friends, I suppose.","",""
"25","59","When I found him in the morning he was cold as ice and stiff as a board.","",""
"25","60","What was the cause of death?","",""
"25","61","They said it was a brain tumor.","",""
"25","62","But on his face was a look of stark, desperate terror such as I've never seen before!","",""
"25","63","Scary!","",""
"25","64","Ireland!","",""
"25","65","What's that?","",""
"25","66","This tripod was found in Ireland!","",""
"25","68","I'm sorry. I was excited.","",""

"25","74","Good night, m'sieur.","",""
"25","75","No, m'sieur!","",""
"25","76","Okay!","",""
"25","77","Do you have a fetish about closets, m'sieur?","",""
"25","78","I just love the smell of mothballs, I guess.","",""
"25","79","Don't even think of climbing in there, m'sieur!","",""
"25","80","You'll be suffocated!","",""
"25","81","I always wondered how it felt to be a mummy.","",""
"25","82","Leave it alone! That closet is over three thousand years old!","",""
"25","83","Closet? It's a sarcophagus!","",""
"25","84","Attention! Please do not open the window, m'sieur!","",""
"25","85","Don't you think it's kinda stuffy in here...?","",""

"25","88","Not just that, m'sieur - there's a new burger bar opened up across the street: the Laughing Buffalo.","",""
"25","89","So what's the problem?","",""
"25","90","They cook their burgers on a charcoal grill, and the fat falls on the open flames.","",""
"25","91","The amount of organic compound and smoke particles released is astounding!","",""
"25","92","Since they opened local air pollution has doubled - and it stinks like a funeral pyre!","",""
"25","93","That's why I keep the windows closed.","",""
"25","94","Don't open that! Remember the burning cattle!","",""
"25","95","Non! m'sieur, non et non!","",""
"25","96","Okay, okay.","",""
"25","97","Now what did I tell you about touching the exhibits?","",""
"25","98","Uh... was it: `You can touch all you want so long as your hands are clean'?","",""
"25","99","Not quite, m'sieur. It was Do Not Touch. Not ever!","",""
"25","100","Oh, yeah - that was it.","",""

"25","102","What's wrong?","",""

"25","110","Oh, no. Fancy you mistaking me for him!","",""
"25","112","But Lobineau does work here?","",""
"25","113","Work? I wouldn't go so far as to call it that...","",""
"25","114","He studies here most days but, as you can see for yourself, not today.","",""

"25","116","Those are remains of pots used by the original inhabitants of Paris.","",""
"25","117","The Paris Pot People...","",""
"25","118","When did they move out?","",""
"25","119","Fifteen thousand years ago, m'sieur. Vanished in the mists of time.","",""
"25","120","Didn't even have time to pack up their pots.","",""
"25","121","I thought the original inhabitants of Paris were a tribe known as the Parisii?","",""
"25","123","You see, in those days, people didn't have much in the way of possessions...","",""
"25","124","A few flints, some animal skins, maybe the odd bone or two...","",""
"25","125","Naturally, when the Parisii came along with their pots, why - everybody wanted one!","",""
"25","126","I guess they must have caused a kind of consumer frenzy...","",""
"25","127","Ah, oui! They cornered the market. Cleaned up!","",""

"25","131","A rare example of silver coinage from the reign of Philip le bel...","",""
"25","132","That little hoard lay buried for centuries, in a field on the outskirts of Paris.","",""
"25","133","They're unique. Nothing like them has been found anywhere else in Europe.","",""
"25","134","Who was Philip le bel?","",""
"25","135","You don't know? Philip the Fourth, the king of France!","",""
"25","136","Wasn't he the guy who wiped out the Knights Templar?","",""
"25","137","I have no idea, m'sieur.","",""
"25","138","All I know is he was king of France.","",""
"25","139","I don't even know why he was called Philip le bel.","",""
"25","140","Do you know anything about medieval manuscripts?","",""
"25","141","Not me, m'sieur. I'm no scholar - though people often mistake me for one.","",""
"25","142","It's the uniform, I guess. They see the clothes, they're impressed...","",""
"25","143","And they ask you to park their cars?","",""
"25","144","They ask me to park their... no, no, no!","",""
"25","146","Whereas, you know next to nothing about history?","",""
"25","147","Of course not! All I'm saying is, I'm no scholar...","",""

"25","155","You don't know anything about the tripod, do you?","",""
"25","156","No, I don't. I never had much of a start in life, you see.","",""
"25","157","I owe what little education I gained to my uncle.","",""
"25","158","He was an optician, but he also doubled as the village school teacher.","",""
"25","159","He taught me the alphabet - well, nineteen letters of it...","",""
"25","160","The bottom row of the chart was too small even for him to read, so he left them out.","",""

"25","174","Yeah, but we skipped over thaumatology.","",""
"25","180","Can I take a closer look at the tripod?","",""
"25","181","What? Get it out of the case? Ah, non!","",""
"25","182","That tripod is protected by a sophisticated surveillance system.","",""
"25","183","How sophisticated?","",""
"25","184","A painfully loud alarm bell.","",""

"25","186","Nothing travels faster than bad news!","",""
"25","188","I always said that alarm was no good!","",""

"25","204","I should think it is.","",""

"25","227","Oui, m'sieur. Most impressive.","",""
"25","228","What do you make of this tissue?","",""

"25","265","No kidding!","",""
"25","266","I just don't get it...","",""
"25","268","A modern-day alchemist perhaps?","",""
"25","269","Who knows? There's no shortage of crazies in Paris.","",""
"25","270","Hey - I visited Nicole's apartment.","",""
"25","272","Whew! Quite a find, Georgie-boy!","",""
"25","273","I didn't expect anything quite so... sexy!","",""
"25","274","I hope you're referring to the manuscript?","",""
"25","275","Mais oui... of course!","",""
"25","276","Where have you been? Nicole said you were away...","",""
"25","277","I just returned from Syria.","",""
"25","278","Syria? On the trail of the Templars?","",""
"25","279","It's a long story - but I found the Bull's Head.","",""
"25","280","It was referred to on the manuscript, remember?","",""
"25","281","Yes. What is it?","",""
"25","282","A secret cave built into a high cliff face.","",""
"25","283","In the cave I discovered a map bearing a phrase in Latin...","",""
"25","285","The Island of Britain...","",""
"25","286","...lies at the edge of the world, to the west.","",""
"25","287","Strange. That map seems to contain a series of pointers...","",""
"25","288","Like I said, it's a treasure map.","",""
"25","289","I think you ought to know that the tripod is going to be stolen.","",""
"25","290","The Lochmarne tripod? No!","",""
"25","291","It's true. I can give you a description of the thieves...","",""
"25","292","Before the supposed event has taken place?","",""
"25","293","I heard them planning the raid.","",""
"25","294","They're wasting their time.","",""
"25","295","The tripod is protected by a state of the art alarm system...","",""
"25","296","Well, don't say I didn't warn you.","",""
"25","297","Why don't you loan the tripod to me, for safe-keeping?","",""
"25","298","Because I'd never see it again.","",""
"25","299","Don't you trust me?","",""
"25","300","It's not a question of trust, George.","",""
"25","301","That tripod is hundreds of years old, and extremely fragile.","",""
"25","302","I get your point.","",""
"25","303","I'd like your opinion on a medieval manuscript.","",""
"25","304","Vraiment? Do you have it with you?","",""
"25","305","No. It's too fragile - and besides...","",""
"25","306","There are certain people who'd stop at nothing to get their hands on it...!","",""
"25","307","Intriguing. Do you have a copy of the text?","",""
"25","308","There isn't much - only from a few latin phrases.","",""
"25","309","I was kind of hoping you'd help decipher the pictures.","",""
"25","310","Without seeing the manuscript? That's a tall order...","",""
"25","311","Just tell me one thing - what does the image of two men riding on the same horse suggest to you?","",""
"25","312","The Knights Templar.","",""
"25","313","Does the Templar seal appear on this manuscript?","",""
"25","314","I'd love to see that for myself!","",""
"25","315","What did you make of the manuscript?","",""
"25","316","It dates from the time of the Crusades.","",""
"25","317","We guessed that, from the Templar seal.","",""
"25","318","It's a story in pictures, like a modern-day comic book.","",""
"25","319","What story does the manuscript tell?","",""
"25","320","I don't know.","",""
"25","321","It was probably produced for the tourist market.","",""
"25","322","Tourists!?","",""
"25","324","The tourist trade is nothing new, you know. It's been around for centuries.","",""
"25","325","Ever since Joshua made a packet selling souvenir bricks from the walls of Jericho.","",""
"25","326","Have you deciphered any of the images on the manuscript?","",""
"25","327","There's very little I can be sure about.","",""
"25","328","The slaying of the bull could be a reference to Mithras.","",""
"25","329","Who's he?","",""
"25","330","A Persian god. Almost as popular as Christ at one time...","",""
"25","331","The only thing I can be sure of is the knight. He's Spanish.","",""
"25","332","How can you tell that?","",""
"25","333","The writing on the shield, the reference to `Ave Maria'...","",""
"25","334","No self respecting knight from northern Europe would have borne a coat of arms like that...","",""
"25","335","Can you identify the Knight's coat of arms?","",""
"25","337","He's a member of the des Vasconcellos family - from the Costa Calida.","",""
"25","338","Were they famous?","",""
"25","339","No. They're not mentioned after the fifteenth century.","",""
"25","340","Oh.","",""
"25","341","The spotlight of history moved on. They're probably long dead.","",""
"25","342","Do you think the manuscript could be a map to the Templar treasure?","",""
"25","343","Frankly, no. That's too far-fetched.","",""
"25","344","The manuscript is interesting enough and a rare find, but that's all.","",""
"25","345","Wouldn't it be terrific if it was a map, though? The treasure of the Knights Templar...","",""
"25","347","The manuscript is being looked after by a friend.","",""
"25","348","In Paris?","",""
"25","349","Yeah. Not far from here, in fact.","",""
"25","350","Well, just give me the address and I'll come round and take a look!","",""
"25","351","I'm not so sure about that.","",""
"25","352","Maybe I should check with her first...","",""
"25","353","A female friend?","",""
"25","354","Yeah. She's a woman.","",""
"25","355","Maybe it was my imagination, but I noticed a predatory look in his eye.","",""
"25","356","Suddenly, this friendly historian had turned into the Big Bad Wolf...","",""
"25","357","This friend who has the manuscript...","",""
"25","358","Ah, oui. The anonymous girl friend.","",""
"25","359","She lives at three sixty-one, Rue Jarry.","",""
"25","360","Ah! I know it well.","",""
"25","361","I'll drop by just as soon as I can.","",""
"25","362","You didn't say you knew Nico at college...?","",""
"25","363","Didn't I? Ah, oui. She was an odd little thing back then...","",""
"25","364","Quite an endearing waif, I suppose, but she always looked so miserable!","",""
"25","365","That's hardly surprising. She was mourning her dad.","",""
"25","366","I know. She wore nothing but black for seven years.","",""
"25","367","She was more Goth then Alaric the Visigoth...","",""
"25","368","While I was in Syria, I discovered a strange, pagan statue.","",""
"25","369","It was like a head with three bearded faces. Horrible!","",""
"25","370","That sounds as if it could be Baphomet - the idol described by the Templars!","",""
"25","371","The Poor Knights of Christ had an idol that looked like that?","",""
"25","372","Allegedly. The description of the idol came from the evidence extracted by the Inquisition.","",""
"25","373","Mind you, not one statue or idol was ever found on Templar property.","",""
"25","374","Until now, that is...","",""
"25","375","Just last month, a statue of Baphomet was unearthed - right here in Paris!","",""
"25","376","Where?","",""
"25","377","At the Institut Hermétique de Nerval.","",""
"25","380","The statue is beneath the foundations.","",""
"25","382","Can you tell me any more about the statue of Baphomet?","",""
"25","383","It's a fearful image, even now... a bearded head.","",""
"25","384","The base of the statue is carved with Templar symbols.","",""
"25","386","He claimed it looked like blood.","",""
"25","387","Blood?","",""
"25","388","That's right.","",""
"25","389","Can you tell me anything about the Knights Templar?","",""
"25","390","I sure can, Georgie!","",""
"25","391","Soldiers, diplomats, mercenaries, monks, bankers - you name it, the Templars fit the bill.","",""
"25","392","The greatest fighting force in Christendom - the militia of Christ!","",""
"25","393","Jeez!","",""
"25","394","How did the Templars get their name?","",""
"25","395","From the building in which they set up their headquarters.","",""
"25","396","The King of Jerusalem gave them part of a mosque on the Temple Mount.","",""
"25","397","It was said to have been the site of the original Temple of Solomon.","",""
"25","398","The order became known first as the Knights of the Temple, and later the Knights Templar.","",""
"25","399","You're a mine of information, André.","",""
"25","401","How come the Templars became so wealthy?","",""
"25","402","There was a constant stream of new recruits to their ranks, many from noble families.","",""
"25","403","They were required to swear a sacred oath of poverty, chastity and obedience.","",""
"25","404","So, their money, goods and land were donated to the order.","",""
"25","405","The Templars soon held land in France, Scotland, England, Spain - most of Europe, in fact.","",""
"25","406","The Poor Knights of Christ became the wealthiest power in Christendom.","",""
"25","410","Is it true the treasure of the Knights Templar was never found?","",""
"25","411","Ah, who knows? So little knowledge of what really happened remains.","",""
"25","412","Or if it does, the truth has never been made public.","",""
"25","413","What do you mean by that?","",""
"25","414","The Templars have attained mythological status, like the King Arthur of the Britons.","",""
"25","415","There are people even now who say the Templars still exist.","",""
"25","416","Do you think that's likely?","",""
"25","417","No, not for a minute.","",""
"25","418","What can you tell me about Philip le bel?","",""
"25","419","He was responsible for the extermination of the Knights Templar.","",""
"25","421","Mostly because he wanted to get his hands on their treasure.","",""
"25","422","He had an enormous debt and a life-long war with England to fund...","",""
"25","423","The trouble was, the Templars were a highly respected holy order.","",""
"25","424","If the Templars were so powerful, how did this Philip dude wipe them out?","",""
"25","425","By underhanded, dishonorable means, of course.","",""
"25","426","The Pope was Clement the Fifth, a Frenchman.","",""
"25","428","Fate had nothing to do with it.","",""
"25","429","He was Philip's puppet, planted to further his political ambitions.","",""
"25","430","Philip wanted the wealth of the Templars and used Clement to get it.","",""
"25","431","What was Philip's plan? What happened...?","",""
"25","432","Sealed orders were sent out all over France, not to be opened until the appointed day.","",""
"25","433","That day was Friday, July thirteenth.","",""
"25","434","That's the origin of our superstition regarding that date.","",""
"25","435","At dawn, throughout the whole of France, the Templars were arrested.","",""
"25","436","It was the biggest bust in the history of the world!","",""
"25","437","What happened to the Templars after their arrest?","",""
"25","438","Philip was out for blood, so he handed the Templars over to the Inquisition.","",""
"25","439","Not surprisingly, they confessed to a sensational and sordid list of blasphemies.","",""
"25","440","Like what?","",""
"25","441","Oh, the sort of things you read about in the gutter press...","",""
"25","442","Devil worship, lewd sexual practices, spitting on the Holy Cross - that kind of thing.","",""
"25","443","That must have given their lawyers some headaches!","",""
"25","444","Whether or not the accusations were true, this was not good publicity.","",""
"25","445","Most of the charges were probably cooked up, but so were the Templars - literally!","",""
"25","446","Hundreds of them were found guilty of heresy and flame-grilled at the stake.","",""
"25","447","They died protesting their innocence.","",""
"25","448","But surely Philip had no proof of his charges against the Templars?","",""
"25","449","A man will admit anything under torture.","",""
"25","450","The Inquisition fabricated some nonsensical demon called `Baphomet'...","",""
"25","451","...and then suggested to their victims that this was what they worshipped.","",""
"25","452","But they didn't have to agree!","",""
"25","453","The records show a Templar coming to trial with both feet burnt off...","",""
"25","454","...fragments of flesh and charred bone falling from the stumps.","",""
"25","456","So there was no truth at all in the Baphomet accusations.","",""
"25","457","Not a shred. Almost every victim described the idol differently.","",""
"25","458","No, Baphomet never existed outside the sick minds of the Inquisitors.","",""
"25","459","So Philip stole the Templars' riches, huh?","",""
"25","460","Oh, no! They weren't stupid!","",""
"25","461","The king's troops marched first on the Temple in Paris, then to the Templar home port, at La Rochelle.","",""
"25","462","There was no trace of the treasure, and the fleet of the Knights Templar had set sail.","",""
"25","463","Does the name Montfauçon mean anything to you?","",""
"25","464","Sure. It was the most grisly spectacle in Paris until the Revolution.","",""
"25","465","A public toilet?","",""
"25","466","Montfauçon was the place of execution for many thousands.","",""
"25","467","A dark temple of death, with row upon row of arches, each one framing a grim exhibit...","",""
"25","468","Scores of rotting corpses swung on creaking rope while the crows devoured their flesh...","",""
"25","469","That explains the image of the hanged man.","",""
"25","470","I found a reference to Montfauçon in Ireland, in a village called Lochmarne.","",""
"25","471","Lochmarne? That's where Peagram was digging!","",""
"25","472","That's right. He'd left the excavation before I arrived.","",""
"25","473","I've read about him.","",""
"25","474","Who's Peagram?","",""
"25","475","An eminent and popular English archaeologist.","",""
"25","476","His TV show took man's past into the top ratings!","",""
"25","477","Where was the site of Montfauçon?","",""
"25","478","To the north-east, near the Canal St. Martin, but there's nothing there now.","",""
"25","479","The old gibbet was torn down during the Revolution.","",""
"25","480","Do you know Peagram well?","",""
"25","481","Not really. I met him at a conference.","",""
"25","482","I would have liked to talk to him in depth, but I didn't have time.","",""
"25","483","When was this?","",""
"25","484","Oh, back in the summer... July, I think.","",""
"25","485","The second week of July?","",""
"25","486","Maybe... Yes, it was. Just before Bastille day.","",""
"25","487","So Peagram was in Paris at the same time as the other victims...","",""
"25","489","Nothing. Just thinking aloud.","",""
"25","490","Have you ever heard of the Hashshashin?","",""
"25","491","Why, yes. It was a radical Muslim sect whose name became synonymous with murder.","",""
"25","492","It was formed in eleventh century Persia, shortly before the Crusades.","",""
"25","493","At roughly the same time as the Templars...","",""
"25","494","Yes. They gave a new word to our language: Assassani - the Assassins.","",""
"25","495","How did the Assassins get their name?","",""
"25","496","From the legend surrounding the secrets of their initiation rites...","",""
"25","497","A young man who sought to join the sect was given hashish until he drifted into dreams.","",""
"25","498","He awoke to find himself in a fabulous garden, with everything he could wish for...","",""
"25","499","The freshest water, the most delicious food, the choicest hash and the most delectable women imaginable.","",""
"25","500","Cool. Do you have the address?","",""
"25","501","I haven't finished the story. There was a price to pay for this taste of paradise.","",""
"25","502","Wouldn't you just know it?","",""
"25","503","The young man would wake the next day to find himself back in the real world.","",""
"25","504","He was told that he'd been given a glimpse of the heaven reserved for holy martyrs.","",""
"25","505","A heaven he would enjoy for eternity - if he was willing to join the Hashshashin.","",""
"25","506","How did the Assassins operate?","",""
"25","507","Well, as I explained, the new recruits would be only too willing to die for the cause.","",""
"25","508","They'd be instructed in the use of the dagger, poisons and disguise.","",""
"25","509","Then, the Grand Master of the sect would name an enemy of Allah.","",""
"25","510","And they'd stop at nothing to eliminate that enemy...","",""
"25","511","You've got it. They were fearless - and deadly.","",""
"25","512","Does the cult of the Assassins still exist?","",""
"25","513","Take a look around at the world today. You tell me...","",""
"25","514","Thanks for your help, André...","",""
"25","515","You're welcome...","",""
"25","516","Do you have any use for this, André?","",""
"25","518","What do you make of this tool?","",""
"25","519","Interesting. Where did you get it?","",""

"25","521","Vraiment? I didn't realize there were any excavations in progress in the City...","",""
"25","522","Did I show you this tool?","",""
"25","523","Yes, you did - though I can't imagine why...","",""

"25","525","It really doesn't interest me, George.","",""
"25","526","Does the guy in this photograph look familiar to you?","",""
"25","527","No.","",""
"25","528","What do you make of this?","",""
"25","529","It's the biggest gemstone I've ever seen!","",""
"25","530","Where did you get it?","",""
"25","531","From Professor Peagram's messenger boy.","",""
"25","532","Peagram! Professor Nigel Peagram?","",""
"25","533","He's in Ireland, investigating a Templar site, isn't he?","",""
"25","534","He was - until he disappeared.","",""
"25","535","Did Peagram find this on his dig?","",""
"25","536","Yeah. The site where this was found was a Templar castle.","",""
"25","537","Do you think it could be part of the Templar treasure?","",""
"25","538","Oh, I shouldn't think so.","",""
"25","539","You're not one of those crazies who think the Templars still exist, are you?","",""
"25","540","Uh... well - I try to keep an open mind on the matter.","",""
"25","541","Did I show you this gem?","",""
"25","542","Yes, you did.","",""

"25","544","Nothing.","",""

"25","547","You sure know your onions...","",""
"25","548","Does this matchbook mean anything to you?","",""
"25","549","Alamut is the name of the place where the Hashshashin were based!","",""
"25","550","Where is it?","",""
"25","551","Somewhere in what used to be called Persia.","",""
"25","552","I'm not too hot on modern geography, I'm afraid.","",""
"25","553","The most recent map I have shows America as an English colony.","",""
"25","554","Are you sure you don't know where Alamut is?","",""
"25","555","Positive.","",""
"25","556","Do you recognize this white powder, André?","",""
"25","558","I'd like to shake you by the hand, André...","",""

"25","565","Aren't you just the tiniest bit embarrassed about your love of juggling?","",""
"25","566","No - why should I be?","",""
"25","567","Oh, André...","",""
"25","569","What would you say if I told you I knew who'd taken the tripod?","",""
"25","570","I'd call the police and have them arrested!","",""
"25","571","That's what I thought.","",""
"25","572","Who was it?","",""
"25","574","That's too bad. If I could get my hands on the thief, I'd wring his neck!","",""
"25","575","No way was I going to give the tripod back to Lobineau...","",""
"25","576","He was a thin-faced pallid guy with a questionable taste in outlandish clothes. My mother used to dress like that.","",""
"25","577","The window was wide open.","",""
"25","578","It was an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus, with a beautifully painted effigy of its owner, on the lid.","",""
"25","579","It is haunted, m'sieur.","",""
"25","580","I will have to ask you to keep your voice down.","",""
"25","581","No. I am the deputy custodian.","",""
"25","582","That is right, m'sieur. Renowned for their pots.","",""
"25","583","Non, m'sieur.","",""
"25","584","They assume I am an authority on the exhibits in my care.","",""
"25","585","Yeah! It doesn't mention John Dee at all.","",""
"25","586","Certainly, m'sieur! It's infamous.","",""
"25","587","Well, whatever he was, that is the tripod he used in his experiments.","",""
"25","588","It is true. It happened last night.","",""
"25","589","It has never failed yet! The sophistication is in its simplicity.","",""
"25","590","Very similar to the one which we used to have here at the museum. In fact...","",""
"25","591","Hmm... no.","",""
"25","592","Hello, Georgie.","",""
"25","593","So many other treasures, and the thieves choose the tripod!","",""
"25","594","Yes - she told me you came by.","",""

"25","596","Ah, oui! Pilgrims, in their thousands, on their way to Jerusalem.","",""
"25","597","I already did, Georgie.","",""
"25","598","A romantic notion, Georgie, but extremely improbable.","",""
"25","599","It was discovered by some workmen while renovating the building.","",""
"25","600","One of the workmen noticed a curious stain at the base.","",""
"25","601","Glad to be of help, Georgie.","",""
"25","602","I know that... but why was Philip so hot to get rid of them?","",""
"25","603","French, huh? Handy for Philip.","",""
"25","604","What would you not admit to, to stop such torment?","",""
"25","605","Pardon? Victims of what?","",""
"25","606","I shouldn't think so, Georgie.","",""
"25","607","Not now, Georgie.","",""
"25","608","Oui?","",""

"27","7","But the modern additions looked like a baseball cap on a statue of a medieval saint.","",""
"28","2","The woman managed to look over worked and hassled though she didn't appear to be doing anything...","",""

"28","5","Excuse me...","",""
"28","7","Is this the Hagenmeyer clinic?","",""
"28","8","That's correct.","",""
"28","9","I thought I was in a garden center...","",""

"28","24","So, do I get to see Marquet before the funeral?","",""
"28","25","That attitude will get you nowhere!","",""

"28","27","So, unless you can prove you're a relative or a close acquaintance, you're wasting your time here.","",""
"28","28","Has Marquet had a visit from a pair of gangsters?","",""
"28","29","I should hope not! Can you describe them?","",""
"28","30","A thin guy who looks like a weasel, and his friend, the gorilla.","",""
"28","31","It sounds as if they escaped from a zoo!","",""
"28","32","Has Marquet been visited by a man in a clown costume?","",""
"28","33","Oh, no.","",""

"28","48","And then some!","",""
"28","49","If nurse Grendel is that bad, how come the authorities tolerate her?","",""
"28","50","She's like part of the furniture.","",""
"28","53","I was beginning to get the picture. This woman was jealous, with a big green capital `J'.","",""

"28","55","Down the corridor on the left, turn right at the Senior Consultants' washroom...","",""

"30","6","This guy didn't look sick to me.","",""
"30","7","He didn't have spots, or stitches, and he certainly didn't have a fever...","",""

"30","12","The poor guy's temperature had been up and down like a white-knuckle ride.","",""
"30","13","No wonder he looked so sick.","",""
"30","14","According to the chart, this guy was called Croquet.","",""
"30","15","The graph showed a steady decline in his pulse rate and an increase in his blood-pressure...","",""
"30","16","It kinda shook me to see this guy's life reduced to a few jagged lines...","",""
"30","17","The name on the chart was Sopmarsh.","",""
"30","18","His temperature was normal, with little fluctuation either way.","",""
"30","19","Oui, m'sieur?","",""
"30","20","Is this ward J-Two?","",""
"30","21","It is, but you are not supposed to be here!","",""
"30","22","We have strict rules about visiting hours.","",""
"30","23","Can't you make an exception? I've come all the way from California!","",""
"30","24","You must speak to the doctor...","",""
"30","25","I can't wait that long. What if he snuffs it?","",""
"30","26","You can't talk like that here! This is a hospital!","",""
"30","27","You will have to leave.","",""

"30","34","Do I have to? That guy's nuts!","",""
"30","35","Docteur, I'm surprised at you!","",""
"30","36","That's no way to talk about our clients!","",""
"30","37","Okay, okay - I'll see him, but I'm telling you - he's a hypochondriac.","",""

"30","46","Yes, sir.","",""

"30","51","What's his problem?","",""
"30","52","He's been complaining of loss of consciousness.","",""
"30","53","You'll need this, docteur...","",""
"30","54","She gave me a long, narrow metal box and a stunning smile...","",""
"30","55","Thanks.","",""
"30","56","Pardon me, nurse...","",""
"30","57","Oui, m'sieur?","",""
"30","58","Do you have a patient named Marquet on this ward?","",""
"30","59","Oui, m'sieur. He is in the private room at the end of the ward.","",""
"30","60","He has been placed in strict isolation.","",""
"30","61","Why is Marquet in quarantine?","",""
"30","63","All I know is that Marquet's room is strictly out of bounds.","",""
"30","64","You can tell me how my brother is, can't you?","",""
"30","65","Of course, m'sieur. What is his name?","",""
"30","66","Jacques Marquet.","",""
"30","67","Let me see...","",""
"30","68","He's `satisfactory'.","",""
"30","69","I was told he was dying!","",""
"30","70","Well, he is. But the doctor described his condition as `satisfactory'.","",""
"30","71","That's quite an improvement on yesterday.","",""
"30","72","Do you know who paid for Marquet's room?","",""
"30","73","No, of course I don't!","",""
"30","74","Preferential treatment like that must cost an arm and a leg...","",""
"30","75","That's not my concern, m'sieur.","",""
"30","76","Is it true that Marquet is suffering from anthrax?","",""
"30","77","Keep your voice down, m'sieur!","",""
"30","78","Who told you that?","",""
"30","79","The cop at the door.","",""
"30","81","Evacuate. That's it. No panic. Women and children first...","",""
"30","82","Has anyone ever told you how cute you are when you go to pieces?","",""
"30","83","So, what precautions do you intend to take to prevent the spread of anthrax?","",""
"30","84","My first step will be to burn the bodies.","",""
"30","85","Burn... the bodies?","",""
"30","86","It won't be easy, I know, but I can do it!","",""
"30","87","Just give me a chance, docteur! Let me burn the patients!","",""
"30","88","I don't think that would be a good idea, Nurse Grendel.","",""
"30","89","I'm sorry, docteur, but the other staff put me up to this.","",""
"30","90","It's because you're new, you see. Traditional hospital humor.","",""
"30","91","Hilarious. Then Marquet hasn't got anthrax?","",""
"30","92","No, sir.","",""
"30","93","Do you have any clowns on the ward?","",""
"30","94","Why, yes - we do. A professional clown.","",""
"30","95","I'll bet he lightens the place up!","",""
"30","96","Hardly. M'sieur Boissy has been in a coma for the last three months.","",""
"30","97","What's wrong with Boissy?","",""
"30","98","He was involved in a very nasty accident.","",""
"30","99","A silly stunt involving a unicycle.","",""

"30","104","You may come back at visiting time, m'sieur.","",""
"30","105","Thanks. When is that?","",""

"30","142","That's right! I've had the problem as long as I can remember.","",""
"30","143","It's a real out of body experience - like death, but not so conclusive.","",""
"30","144","I see. How long does it last?","",""
"30","145","Just a fraction of a second, then I recover.","",""
"30","146","I might not have been a doctor, but I was formulating a diagnosis all the same...","",""
"30","147","This guy was nuts.","",""
"30","149","Is it serious?","",""

"32","7","Why he couldn't put that kind of application into getting a real job I had no idea.","",""
"32","8","Maybe he just liked dressing up like a horse's ass.","",""
"32","9","I once read a list of low stress jobs...","",""

"32","11","Obviously, this guy hadn't read the same list.","",""
"32","13","Last time I visited one of those, it blew up.","",""

"32","15","It was the glass the gendarme had left behind.","",""
"32","16","There was no need to take the wineglass.","",""
"32","17","At the top of the stairs was a medieval church.","",""
"32","18","Fixed to the wall was a sign in three languages.","",""
"32","19","In French, English and German it read...","",""
"32","20","`In thirteen twelve, Pope Clement V dissolved the Knightly Order of the Templars...","",""

"32","42","Non! I am a jongleur!","",""
"32","43","A jongler? What's that?","",""

"32","45","In centuries past, the courts of the crowned heads of Europe had their jongleurs.","",""
"32","46","Witty, erudite men to whom the monarchs turned in their hours of need.","",""

"32","53","Oh, it does not, does it not?","",""
"32","54","Perhaps you feel you could do better, non?","",""
"32","55","I'll give it a try.","",""
"32","56","Be my guest...","",""
"32","57","I had no idea what I was doing.","",""
"32","58","But this guy was obviously an idiot so how difficult could it be?","",""
"32","59","A lot more difficult than I'd thought, that's how difficult.","",""
"32","60","Still, it was my big chance to be derided by complete strangers.","",""
"32","61","Not so easy after all, is it?","",""
"32","62","No, I guess not.","",""
"32","63","I'd like to have another try at juggling, please.","",""

"32","67","Allow me to demonstrate. The balls, please.","",""
"32","68","If you insist on completing your humiliation, m'sieur.","",""
"32","69","Okay, now for my secret weapon.","",""
"32","70","The juggler was speechless with rage.","",""
"32","71","You could have mistaken him for a mime.","",""
"32","72","And without a word he collected his balls...","",""
"32","73","...and left in a fury.","",""
"32","74","Hey! You forgot one of your balls! Hey!","",""
"32","75","But he didn't hear.","",""
"32","76","Better still, deprived of his entertainment...","",""
"32","77","...the gendarme decided maybe he ought to do some policing for a change.","",""
"32","78","What do you know about the Knights Templar?","",""
"32","80","...on an island in the Seine in thirteen fourteen.","",""

"36","143","Impossible. They would've hired somebody competent in that case...","",""
"36","144","Meaning what?","",""

"36","146","...all epaulettes and no brains. ","",""
"36","147","Why, you...","",""
"36","148","This looked set to carry on for some time. It was too good an opportunity to miss.","",""

"36","155","She asked for `that hunk of man with the nicotine fingers and his ass hanging out of his pants'.","",""
"36","156","Hmmm. That shade of paint seems... familiar.","",""
"36","157","Not at this exact moment, no.","",""
"36","158","Yes. It's a communion chalice.","",""
"36","159","Yes, me. What's so funny about that?","",""
"36","160","Pah!","",""
"36","161","Don't `Pah!' me, you elephantine oaf! My job is important!","",""
"37","1","There was a telephone on the far wall.","",""

"37","18","He looked pretty pompous. Well - not so much pretty, just pompous.","",""
"37","20","The door was locked.","",""
"37","21","That guard had been put here to guard something.","",""
"37","22","My guess was that the excavation was behind that door.","",""

"37","24","...I had a hunch that door was locked.","",""
"37","25","I couldn't get to the door while the guard was there.","",""
"37","26","The doorway was full of assorted old tea chests, cardboard boxes and so on, all empty and all uninteresting.","",""

"37","74","Never mind. Here's the key.","",""
"37","75","What do you know about the Knights Templar?","",""
"37","76","There was a long pause during which the guard said nothing. Then he said...","",""
"37","77","Nothing.","",""

"37","80","What? Like a history pop test?","",""
"37","81","No. Like a ...test.","",""
"37","82","Okay, yes. It's a test.","",""
"37","83","Then I know absolutely nothing about the Templars.","",""

"37","147","I'm at the excavation but they won't let me in.","",""
"37","148","Damn! We need to know what's in there!","",""
"37","149","Don't worry, I've got a scheme. I'm going to need your help though.","",""
"37","150","Okay, what do you want me to do?","",""
"37","151","I want you to keep somebody on the 'phone for a while.","",""
"37","152","Who?","",""
"37","153","A painter. I need to get at his pot.","",""
"37","154","Oh, okay.","",""
"37","155","Stay on the line, I'll go and get him.","",""
"37","156","Hi, Nico! It's me again!","",""
"37","157","I'd guessed. What do you want this time?","",""
"37","158","What did you say to the painter?","",""
"37","159","I shan't repeat it, George.","",""
"37","160","Look, I need to get the guard out of the way.","",""
"37","161","Could you call back and ask him to get the painter again?","",""
"37","162","Okay, I'll call back soon.","",""
"37","163","Hello, Nico. It's me.","",""
"37","164","What do you want?","",""

"37","167","I can't hold your hand all of the time. Au revoir.","",""
"37","168","I wouldn't mind if you held it at least some of the time.","",""
"37","169","Hello, Collard.","",""
"37","170","Hi, Nico. I messed up.","",""
"37","171","You messed up? What are you going to do now?","",""
"37","172","Uh, could you, you know, talk to the painter again?","",""
"37","173","I don't know. I kind of burnt my bridges there.","",""
"37","174","Please, you could try.","",""
"37","175","Okay, okay, just don't get all puppy dog on me.","",""
"37","176","Go and get him.","",""
"37","177","Hello?","",""
"37","178","Hi!","",""
"37","179","George? What happened?","",""
"37","180","Uh...","",""
"37","181","You messed up again? Why is this so difficult?","",""
"37","182","Uh...","",""
"37","183","I guessed so. Just go and get him.","",""
"37","184","Salut, George.","",""
"37","185","How did you know it was going to be me?","",""
"37","186","Who else was it going to be? Is the coast clear?","",""
"37","187","Yeah. The guard and the painter are outside having a major argument.","",""
"37","188","So what is so secret about the excavation?","",""
"37","189","Well, I haven't actually...","",""
"37","190","George! How long do you think the guard's going to be distracted?","",""
"37","191","Get in there and find out what the Templars hid!","",""
"37","192","Okay, okay.","",""
"37","193","Hi, Nico! It's me! I'm at the excavation site!","",""
"37","194","The false key looked pretty convincing but it felt exactly like what it was - painted plaster!","",""
"37","195","I figured it wouldn't be smart to show too many people that I had it.","",""
"37","196","I turned the heating off.","",""
"37","197","There was a closed door with `Toilet' scratched into the cheap veneer.","",""
"38","1","Oh, great. More dead people.","",""
"38","2","Although the gendarmes weren't likely to pull in any suspects unless they had a time machine.","",""
"38","3","This guy must have been here for centuries.","",""
"38","4","No, thanks. I think I'm carrying enough junk.","",""
"38","5","Now there's a familiar face...","",""
"38","8","There was no doubt about it...","",""
"38","9","...it was the same sort of idol I'd seen in Syria.","",""
"38","10","Baphomet. The Templars had certainly been through here.","",""
"38","11","In the middle of the floor was a weird mosaic...","",""
"38","12","...all swirling and distorted.","",""
"38","13","Close up, the pattern didn't make any sort of sense.","",""
"38","14","It fanned out around an axis point, a kind of focus to one side.","",""
"38","15","And there it was, decoded by the curves of the chalice...","",""
"38","16","... the image of a church.","",""
"38","17","Some planks used to make the catwalk were leaning against the wall.","",""
"38","18","I couldn't see anything useful to do with the planks. ","",""
"39","4","There was a big, old boiler used for heating the building.","",""
"39","5","The thing felt really hot. Big demands seemed to be being made on it.","",""
"39","6","A huge pile of coal lay in the corner to fuel the boiler.","",""
"39","7","Real high tech stuff.","",""
"39","8","I didn't want any coal.","",""
"39","9","The shovel used to feed the furnace was stuck into the pile of coal.","",""
"39","10","Capacious as my pockets were, I didn't figure I could cram a shovel in them.","",""
"39","11","I didn't need to get near to tell the toilet needed cleaning.","",""
"39","12","Being in a charming comfort station like this made me think fondly of the toilet in Syria.","",""
"39","13","That place was kept in pretty good order.","",""
"39","14","At least, it had been until I vandalised it. Still, it was all for a good cause.","",""
"39","15","A bin stood in the corner. It didn't look like it had been emptied for a while.","",""
"39","16","I wasn't that interested in what might go into a restroom's garbage to investigate.","",""
"39","17","A filthy washbasin hung on the wall.","",""
"39","18","I didn't want to use that unless I really had to. ","",""
"39","19","A hand drier was mounted on the wall.","",""
"39","20","If the Club Alamut had used one of these instead of a roller towel...","",""
"39","21","...I'd probably still be stuck in Marib.","",""
"39","22","Oh boy, dirty soap. How do they do that?","",""
"39","23","The taps were rusty. Oh, boy.","",""
"39","24","The cold tap's washer looked to have failed. It was just dribbling down the sink.","",""
"39","25","I figured washing my hands with that soap in that sink would just get my hands dirtier than when I'd started.","",""
"39","26","That was a smart way to get a key made out of water.","",""
"39","27","Now all I needed was a nitrogen bath to freeze it in and I'd have a usable key.","",""
"39","28","Well, it had taken a while but I had made myself a completely unconvincing plaster key.","",""
"39","29","Way too fragile to use in a lock. I'd have to substitute it for the real one.","",""
"39","30","Trouble was, it looked like plaster and not metal.","",""
"39","31","Then again, that plaster statue in Syria hadn't looked like stone until I'd been a bit `artful' with it.","",""
"39","32","Maybe I could improve the key as well.","",""
"39","33","On the wall was a automatic hand drier.","",""
"39","34","I wasn't about to wash my hands in this place so I didn't need to dry them.","",""
"39","35","There was a ventilation grill up in the wall.","",""
"39","37","...wedged myself into the tiny hole, smashed the far cover out and plunged headfirst into the next room...","",""
"39","38","...or I could just go through the door like a sane person.","",""
"39","39","I could have climbed on to the sink, prised the ventilator cover loose...","",""
"40","1","The fall hadn't done the statuette much good. It had lost its arms and gotten pretty chipped.","",""
"40","2","*","",""
"40","3","It's an eternal truth. There's always somebody ready to sell you junk you don't want or need. ","",""
"40","5","The cat was an ugly brute who looked like he owned the joint. ","",""
"40","6","Oh, bad tempered as well as ugly... ","",""
"40","7","As I didn't see the point of going all the way over there to get scratched, I stayed where I was. ","",""
"40","8","It was the sort of bell you see in hotel receptions. Kind of unexpected here.","",""
"40","9","An old executive toy and a cheap plaster statuette. There didn't seem much helpful around here.","",""
"40","10","I had neither the money nor the desire to buy any of that garbage.","",""
"40","11","That statuette was the nearest thing to an antiquity I'd seen but it still looked like a cheap plaster copy to me.","",""
"40","12","I wasn't sure whether I wanted anything off that shelf. ","",""
"40","13","The shelf looked even more forlorn now the statuette was gone. ","",""
"40","14","I didn't see the need for an old `Newton's Cradle' toy. ","",""
"40","15","It's probably still there if anybody wants it. ","",""
"40","16","There were some great bargains on the shelf. Providing you ran a junk museum.","",""
"40","17","I hadn't come all this way to seek out curios. ","",""
"40","18","The rifle looked dangerous. To the user.","",""
"40","19","I didn't really want to lug the rifle around with me. ","",""
"40","20","The stand was hawking ancient machine parts.","",""
"40","21","The stand was hawking ancient machine parts that seemed to be from a stripped down printing press. ","",""
"40","22","I couldn't imagine where they'd come from or who'd want them. . ","",""
"40","23","How did this guy make a living selling useless old machine parts in the middle of nowhere?","",""
"40","24","He didn't have anything that I needed. ","",""
"40","25","The merchant was selling fruit. I decided I might have some later.","",""
"40","26","The stand was selling some fruit I didn't recognize.  ","",""
"40","28","The guy running the stand seemed pretty happy. People always want fruit. ","",""
"40","29","I wasn't hungry and didn't want to buy fruit so I didn't start a conversation.","",""
"40","30","It was a kebab stand and an ugly one at that. ","",""
"40","31","In the still air, the smell hung around like bad smells do.   ","",""
"40","32","The stand had kebabs dangling from the canopy. ","",""
"40","33","As a marketing device, it lacked something. ","",""
"40","34","Close up, I could see flies love kebabs.","",""
"40","35","So this was Ultar's `Luxury taxi'. Plenty of luggage space, I guess. ","",""
"40","36","I didn't know where I was going. That's what I'd hired Ultar for.  ","",""
"40","37","The stall holder's face wasn't a great ad for running a kebab stand.  ","",""
"40","38","Suddenly I realized the horrific truth. ","",""
"40","39","The guy was basting the kebabs with the toilet brush.","",""
"40","40","It may never have seen the inside of a toilet bowl but it was still hardly appetizing.   ","",""
"40","41","Arto had murder in his eyes. ","",""
"40","42","What the hell had I said to him? ","",""
"40","45","Embarrassed as I am to admit it...","",""
"40","46","...you can spot an American tourist a mile off. ","",""
"40","47","I don't know. Even though he was obviously a countryman of mine...","",""
"40","48","...there was something about the guy that gave me a weird feeling.","",""
"40","49","The stand was being watched by a young boy, maybe twelve years old. ","",""
"40","50","Nejo was still by the stand and still looking bored. ","",""
"40","51","Despite getting the ball, Nejo still looked bored but I thought it was an act.","",""
"40","52","I wondered how long his control would last before he started playing with his new toy.","",""
"40","53","Nejo was a strange one all right. He was smart but a simple ball could still keep him happy.   ","",""
"40","54","His father had confiscated the ball and Nejo was bored again. ","",""
"40","55","I felt kind of responsible. I hoped he'd get it back soon. ","",""
"40","59","It was a guess, but I figured the woman to be an American tourist. ","",""
"40","60","Just call me Sherlock.  ","",""
"40","61","Pearl was actually as close to decency as she could be.","",""
"40","62","Syria's a pretty conservative country. They don't like women displaying legs and shoulders. ","",""
"40","63","I wondered if the respect for local custom was accidental or deliberate. ","",""
"40","64","Ultar was standing around at a loose end.","",""
"40","65","I had a feeling that something was wrong. Again.","",""
"40","66","Marib looked pretty defendable with a high wall all around it.  ","",""
"40","67","I figured going out into the countryside was a pretty good way to get lost. ","",""
"40","68","Hi, what's your name, sir?","",""
"40","69","Hello again, sir.","",""

"45","177","Mr. Stobbart. I am sure that you are just what you appear to be...","",""

"46","1","Around the corner I found the corpse.","",""
"46","2","Oh, my God! Klausner?","",""
"46","3","Large as life and twice as dead. ","",""
"46","4","I'd hardly had time to accept the fact when I heard the door mechanism start up again. ","",""
"46","5","Aw, man! No!  ","",""
"46","7","I had a bad feeling about how Klausner had died.  ","",""
"46","8","I examined the door carefully, high...","",""
"46","9","...and low.","",""
"46","10","I looked for levers and rings to pull, panels and buttons to push like in the movies...","",""
"46","11",".... and found nothing.","",""
"46","12","I couldn't help but notice...","",""
"46","13","...faint bloody finger marks on the rock...","",""
"46","14","...as if somebody had tried to claw their way out.","",""
"46","16","The key had got me through one secret door in Paris.","",""
"46","17","Not this time, though.","",""
"46","18","There were no leverage points and this door definitely wasn't made from thin plaster.","",""
"46","19","Without getting too close...","",""
"46","20","...I couldn't see any marks of violence.","",""
"46","21","Apart from his finger tips being scraped raw...","",""
"46","22","...and that seemed self-inflicted.","",""
"46","23","Klausner had been pretty smart to get this far...","",""
"46","24","...but he was still dead.","",""
"46","25","Okay. All right.","",""
"46","26","I've done more fun things in my life than searching a corpse...","",""

"46","29","I'd found some kind of lens...","",""
"46","30","...a very old lens made from a very hard glass.","",""
"46","31","That settled it.","",""
"46","32","The knight on the manuscript had been holding a lens the whole time, not a crystal ball.","",""
"46","33","I'd searched Klausner once and knew that the lens was the only thing he'd been carrying.","",""
"46","34","No portable phone, no demolition charges, no five course meal.","",""
"46","35","You'd think international conspirators would go around better equipped.","",""
"46","36","The work that had gone into this place was impressive.","",""
"46","37","I had to hand it to the Templars, when they built a secret cave, they built a quality secret cave.","",""
"46","38","Without explosives or a pick ax, there wasn't a whole bundle I could do to the brickwork.","",""
"46","39","Up on the wall was an inscription, partially eroded by the ages.","",""
"46","40","Something, something, `In occidenta sita est in ora mundi'.","",""

"46","47","That would have to do. ","",""
"46","48","A stone head bearing three bearded faces.","",""

"46","50","...redolent with antiquity and ancient mysteries.","",""
"46","51","Sure was an ugly one though.","",""

"46","59","Please do not make any sudden moves. I have no desire to maim you.","",""
"46","60","Did you say `maim'?","",""
"46","61","I did. Dead men tell no tales, as you say...","",""

"46","64","Then I shall, most regrettably, have to kill you.","",""
"46","65","Rest assured, however, that I am an excellent shot. You would not suffer.","",""
"46","66","That's good. Believe me, I'm really assured.","",""
"46","67","It is rather dark in here. I think we should conduct our business outside.","",""
"46","68","Why should I make myself an easier target?","",""
"46","69","If I fire at you, Mr Stobbart, I shall hit you - even in here.","",""
"46","71","It could be the difference between hitting you in the leg...","",""
"46","72","...or the groin.","",""
"46","74","No sudden moves, Mr Stobbart.","",""
"46","75","The mouth... it's opening! It must be Ultar!","",""
"46","76","Oh, my God! If he comes in we'll both be trapped!","",""
"46","77","But unfortunately, my marksmanship will suffer.","",""
"46","78","It sure is hot in here! ","",""
"46","79","The door had slammed shut, trapping me.","",""
"47","1","The Countess de Vasconcellos seemed a lot happier than the last time we met.","",""
"47","3","It was a large window with shutters.","",""
"47","4","From the window I could see the garden.","",""
"47","5","Including Lopez who was still watering the damn thing.","",""
"47","6","It was a large window with shutters.","",""
"47","7","From the window I could see some sort of balcony.","",""
"47","8","It didn't look like it was used often.","",""
"47","9","An old grandfather clock stood against the wall.","",""
"47","10","I doubted the Templars had hidden anything in there. ","",""
"47","11","There was a boar's head over the fire. It didn't look very happy.","",""
"47","13","Now, what the hell was I going to do with a hog's head?","",""
"47","14","Military hardware, medieval style.","",""
"47","15","I came here to solve a mystery, not go jousting.","",""
"47","16","The fire was made up and ready, waiting for the year to turn cold. ","",""
"47","17","It was way too warm to light the fire.","",""
"47","18","Beside the fire was a stack of logs for fuel.","",""
"47","19","Now what would I want with a bunch of logs?","",""
"47","20","There was a bookcase, bureau kind of affair.","",""
"47","21","I didn't recognize any of the titles apart from an ancient edition of Don Quixote.","",""
"47","22","¡Madre Dios! Who are you?","",""
"47","23","My name's George Stobbart. I'm sorry to burst in like this...","",""
"47","24","You must leave at once! You are not wanted here.","",""
"47","25","Please! If you'd just listen a minute...","",""
"47","26","Very well. State your business, señor Stobbart. ","",""
"47","27","There's been a series of murders - part of some conspiracy.","",""
"47","28","Anyway, the trail led me here.","",""
"47","29","Here? There is nothing for the outside world here.","",""
"47","30","Over six hundred years ago there was.","",""
"47","31","What do you mean?","",""
"47","32","This whole thing ties in somehow with the Knights Templar.","",""
"47","33","The Knights Templar are dust.","",""
"47","34","They had a secret that was so important they went to a lot of trouble to hide it.","",""
"47","35","I do not see what this has to do with my family.","",""
"47","36","Your family had a strong connection with the Templars, right?","",""
"47","37","I believe that they planted some clue here!","",""
"47","38","Why should I believe a complete stranger who barges into my home?","",""
"47","39","Just let me have a look around. If I find nothing...","",""
"47","40","You'll be spending the night at the police station. ","",""
"47","41","Very well, please sit down.","",""
"47","43","I know your family is involved with the Templars but I don't know how.","",""
"47","44","You should be asking how my family WERE involved, señor Stobbart.","",""
"47","46","I'm sorry.","",""
"47","47","Don't be.","",""
"47","48","Okay. Whatever happened, happened almost seven hundred years ago.","",""
"47","49","So if the Templars left any clues, they're going to be in stuff that dates back to the early fourteenth century.","",""
"47","50","Obviously.","",""
"47","51","So what do you have around here that's early medieval?","",""
"47","52","Early medieval. Let me think.","",""
"47","53","Well, the house is relatively modern, a scant three centuries old.","",""
"47","54","Oh, of course! The chess set!","",""
"47","55","That chess set is over six hundred years old?","",""
"47","56","It must be worth a fortune!","",""
"47","57","Indeed it is. Not that I would part with it, of course.","",""
"47","58","No, I wouldn't either. That's the sort of thing that gets handed down to your children.","",""
"47","59","Sorry...","",""
"47","60","Its value is less than you might think. The set is not complete.","",""
"47","61","One of the pieces is a modern replacement. As to the original...","",""
"47","62","...it was lost a long time ago.","",""
"47","63","Nobody has any idea where it is?","",""
"47","64","No. The children had it when they were taken.","",""
"47","65","Children? What children?","",""
"47","66","All in good time, señor Stobbart.","",""
"47","67","May I examine the chess set?","",""
"47","68","Certainly - but do not move any of the pieces.","",""
"47","69","Okay. Thanks.","",""
"47","70","Close up, the modern piece stood out like a sore thumb.","",""
"47","71","There was something else odd about the set.","",""
"47","72","All of the original pieces had irregular bases.","",""
"47","73","My lady, I have to warn you there's a...","",""
"47","74","You! Why, I'll feed you to the dogs!","",""
"47","75","Lopez! What have I told you about feeding intruders to the dogs?","",""
"47","76","But, my lady...","",""
"47","77","Never without my permission.","",""
"47","78","Señor Stobbart, If I find that you are wasting my time...","",""
"47","79","...you will be fed to the dogs.","",""
"47","80","Now, I want to show you something interesting.","",""
"47","81","Follow me...","",""
"47","82","I wanted to get every shred of information out of the Countess that I could.","",""
"47","83","She was the first person I'd met who had a personal and historical interest in what was going on.","",""
"47","84","Does this tissue mean anything to you?","",""
"47","85","Where is this line of questioning going?","",""
"47","86","Nowhere helpful...","",""
"47","87","Does this red nose means anything to you?","",""
"47","88","Oh, dear. El Flojo.","",""
"47","89","That would be the TV clown, yeah?","",""
"47","90","Clown in all important aspects.","",""
"47","91","Apart from the one about being funny.","",""
"47","92","Who the heck is El Flojo?","",""
"47","93","Life is appalling enough without wasting time on him, trust me.","",""
"47","94","Do you recognize this man?","",""
"47","95","No, I have never seen him before in my life. Who is he?","",""
"47","96","I've got a couple of names for him but they're probably false.","",""
"47","97","He's the killer.","",""
"47","98","No, his face is utterly unfamiliar.","",""
"47","99","Good. At least he hasn't been here. Yet.","",""
"47","100","Do you recognize this man?","",""
"47","101","No.","",""
"47","102","I got this ball off a juggler in Paris.","",""
"47","103","I couldn't juggle, see? And he thought he was so superior...","",""
"47","104","...but, and this is the funny part, I put a red nose on and made out that I was trying to be incompetent. ","",""
"47","105","It brought the house down.","",""
"47","106","He was so angry 'cos I'd upstaged...","",""
"47","107","Yeah. Well. You had to be there.","",""
"47","108","I fear that you are probably right, senor Stobbart.","",""
"47","109","Did I tell you how I got this ball?","",""
"47","110","Unfortunately, yes. ","",""
"47","111","Does this matchbook mean anything to you?","",""
"47","112","`Club Alamut'. Not an establishment that I am familiar with, young man.","",""
"47","113","Do you know what this is?","",""
"47","114","Desiccated gypsum.","",""
"47","115","No, it's plaster of Paris.","",""
"47","116","Plaster of Paris is desiccated gypsum, isn't it?","",""
"47","117","I could tell that I wasn't impressing her.","",""
"47","118","Does this lab pass mean anything to you?","",""
"47","119","Nothing at all.","",""
"47","120","Do you know what this is?","",""
"47","121","No. It looks very practical, though.","",""
"47","122","Would you like to shake hands?","",""
"47","123","A formal bow will suffice.","",""
"47","128","Before I left, though, there was one last thing to do.","",""
"47","129","You won't be needing that replacement piece any more, Countess.","",""
"47","130","I found it with the children.","",""
"47","131","You'll probably want to be alone for a while.","",""
"47","132","I'll be out in the garden with Lopez.","",""
"47","134","Hi, Countess. The pleasure's all mine.","",""
"47","135","I've brought back your chalice...","",""
"47","136","Why, you've had it cleaned!","",""
"47","137","Yeah, I met an obliging priest with a soft cloth.","",""
"47","138","Have you resolved the Templar mystery?","",""
"47","139","No, not yet.","",""
"47","140","I don't even know what it is I'm after.","",""
"47","141","There are many stories of the Knights secreting great wealth away...","",""
"47","142","Whatever. All I know is I don't want the bad guys to get it.","",""
"47","143","Ah, to be young and live in a world of moral absolutes.","",""
"47","144","Hello again.","",""
"47","145","Hello again. Mind if I sit?","",""
"47","146","Please, be my guest.","",""
"47","147","I discovered something amazing with that chalice.","",""
"47","148","In Paris, I found a church where they recognised the coat of arms.","",""
"47","149","I've found the tomb of Don Carlos de Vasconcellos.","",""
"47","150","You are sure? There can be no mistake?","",""
"47","151","The coat of arms on the chalice matches the one on the tomb.","",""
"47","152","Incredible! You have my most profound thanks. I must go there as soon as possible! ","",""
"47","153","Yeah! I'd be happy to show you the city. ","",""
"47","154","There's something else that I discovered carved on Don Carlos' tomb...","",""
"47","155","Biblical references.","",""
"47","156","What are the references, señor Stobbart?","",""
"47","157","Psalms, thirty two, seven, Corinthians...","",""
"47","158","I am not a good enough scholar to know the Bible chapter and verse.","",""
"47","159","I meant - what are the quotations?","",""
"47","160","You know, I forgot to ask the priest.","",""
"47","161","There's still the mystery of the missing chess piece...","",""
"47","162","I do not think that it will ever be discovered...","",""
"47","163","...unless the fate of the children is revealed.","",""
"47","164","The Inquisition were suspected of taking the chalice and the kids, right?","",""
"47","166","...they did not take the children either?","",""
"47","167","Then what happened to them?","",""
"47","168","The Inquisition admitted to killing Don Carlos' manservant.","",""
"47","169","Now this guy had been told to protect the kids at all costs, right?","",""
"47","170","That is correct.","",""
"47","171","I think he hid them and the chalice when he got wind that the Inquisition was coming.","",""
"47","172","With him dead and Don Carlos driven mad with grief, there was nobody left who knew the secret.","",""
"47","173","You know what this means, don't you?","",""
"47","174","I fear so. The children are still here, somewhere.","",""
"47","175","If this is so...","",""
"47","176","...then it is small wonder that the de Vasconcellos are cursed.","",""
"47","177","I'll have a look around, if that's okay?","",""
"47","178","My home is your home. I shall remain here.","",""
"47","179","I'll just have another look around.","",""
"47","180","Very well.","",""
"47","181","Here's the Bible from the mausoleum.","",""
"47","182","Very well. Let us begin. The first reference?","",""
"47","183","Psalms, thirty two, seven.","",""
"47","184","`Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.'","",""
"47","185","`My hiding place'!","",""
"47","187","You are right, of course. The next?","",""
"47","188","Okay. John, four, eleven.","",""
"47","189","John... four...","",""
"47","190","...eleven. Here! `The well is deep'. ","",""
"47","191","The next! Quickly!","",""
"47","192","Okay, okay. Uh, Corinthians, four, five.","",""
"47","193","Here it is! `Will bring to light the hidden things.'","",""
"47","194","Any more?","",""
"47","195","Just one. Psalms again. Twenty-two, twenty-one.","",""
"47","196","`Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.'","",""
"47","197","The last is confusing. Lions? Unicorns? What does it mean?","",""
"47","198","I can't guess.","",""
"47","199","The salient points seem to be a hiding place and a deep well.","",""
"47","200","In no sense is the mausoleum a well, señor Stobbart.","",""
"47","201","Is there a well in the grounds?","",""
"47","202","I do not know. I suppose that there must have been, once upon a time.","",""
"47","203","Lopez is the man to ask about anything pertaining to the estate.","",""

"47","223","What do you make of this?","",""
"47","224","It looks like some sort of key. Where did you get it from?","",""
"47","225","It was buried inside the great candle in the mausoleum.","",""
"47","226","Inside it? What have you done to it?","",""
"47","227","I, uh, lit it.","",""
"47","228","But it is irreplaceable!","",""
"47","229","Listen, the candle was to be lit in case of Moorish attack, right?","",""
"47","230","Well, it burnt down in no time and revealed this key thing.","",""
"47","231","Maybe that was the real purpose of lighting the candle.","",""
"47","232","What are you suggesting?","",""
"47","233","That lighting the candle was the equivalent of `Break glass in case of emergency'.","",""
"47","234","Sentiment must not stand in the way of solving this mystery. You did the right thing.","",""
"47","235","It is the stone key that you showed me earlier, is it not?","",""

"47","242","The door won't slow them down much but they still don't have the key to  the puzzle itself.","",""

"48","7","The pressure sleeve had done a good job of closing off the hose.","",""
"48","8","The hose ran from some sort of utility room all the way to the lawn.","",""
"48","9","I didn't like the idea of carrying thirty yards of hose around with me so I left it alone.","",""
"48","10","The older part of the house looked like the remains of a castle gatehouse.","",""
"48","11","Was this what the clues were pointing to?","",""
"48","12","I couldn't get in that way.","",""
"48","13","The main part of the house was old, but nowhere near as old as the gatehouse section.","",""
"48","14","Mausoleum, summerhouse. Easy mistake to make.","",""
"48","15","I'm no student of architecture but the little building looked old.","",""
"48","16","I wondered if it was some sort of summerhouse.","",""
"48","17","So that was what a hazel tree looks like.","",""
"48","18","I went over to find a suitable stick.","",""
"48","19","I don't believe it!","",""
"48","20","There wasn't a single usable `Y' shaped branch on the whole damn thing.","",""
"48","21","It looked a lot like a hazel tree.","",""
"48","22","I went over to find a suitable stick.","",""
"48","23","Ah-ha!","",""
"48","24","It was the driveway down to the main road.","",""
"48","25","I didn't want to leave just yet, though.","",""
"48","26","Down the long, dusty driveway was a road along which a bus traveled maybe twice a day.","",""
"48","27","I knew because I'd arrived on one.","",""
"48","28","And no way was I leaving until I'd got something concrete to show Nico.","",""
"48","29","That didn't look like a good way in.","",""
"48","30","A portcullis says things a `No Trespassing' sign never can.","",""
"48","31","It was then I realized I'd left home without my pocket siege engine.","",""
"48","33","Hey! You!","",""
"48","34","Where do you think you are going?","",""
"48","35","Just having a look around.","",""
"48","36","Not without the Countess, you're not.","",""
"48","37","I don't know how you've got her confidence but you haven't got mine.","",""
"48","40","Uh... yes?","",""
"48","41","I've already told you! You are NOT ALLOWED IN THE HOUSE!","",""
"48","42","Understand?","",""
"48","43","Uh... okay.","",""
"48","44","Yeah? What is it?","",""
"48","45","You would not like it if people just wandered into your home, would you?","",""
"48","46","Well, no. I guess not.","",""
"48","47","Then show a little consideration.","",""
"48","48","Okay. Sorry.","",""
"48","49","My hose has stopped.","",""
"48","50","Yeah?","",""
"48","51","Si. My hose never stops.","",""
"48","52","Well, I'm sorry to hear it. It's always sad when an old tradition comes to an end.","",""
"48","53","Did you have anything to do with it?","",""
"48","54","Si. You.","",""
"48","55","Well, I'm shocked. I'm mortified. How could you think such a thing?","",""
"48","56","Very easily, señor. Very easily.","",""
"48","57","I'm going to find out why my hose has stopped...","",""
"48","58","...and that means going into the house.","",""
"48","59","You are not, absolutely not to go in the house.","",""
"48","60","If you do go in the house, I will set the dogs on you.","",""
"48","61","Hi! Is this the de Vasconcellos house?","",""
"48","62","Hello again.","",""
"48","63","Who wants to know?","",""
"48","64","I could tell the old coot was going to be trouble.","",""
"48","65","My name's George Stobbart. I was wondering whether...","",""
"48","66","The house is not open to the public. ","",""
"48","67","This is the de Vasconcellos house?","",""
"48","68","And what business is that of yours, señor?","",""
"48","69","Look, all I want is to speak to the head of the household.","",""
"48","70","There IS no household. Only the Countess and myself.","",""
"48","71","You again.","",""
"48","72","Yeah, and it's a real bonus to see your smiling face too.","",""
"48","73","He didn't hear me..","",""
"48","74","Tell me about the Countess de Vasconcellos.","",""
"48","75","She doesn't receive guests. That's all you need to know.","",""
"48","76","You don't even know what I have to talk to her about!","",""
"48","77","She hasn't won the lottery, has she?","",""
"48","78","Uh, yes! That's it, the Countess has won the lottery and I'm here to give her the check!","",""
"48","79","Marvelous! May I see it?","",""
"48","80","No! I mean, no, I have to deliver it in person.","",""
"48","81","The Countess doesn't do the lottery. ","",""
"48","82","Oh, for crying out loud! Why'd you lead me on, then?","",""
"48","83","To amuse myself. To make you look a fool. To make you go away.","",""
"48","84","No, she hasn't won the lottery.","",""
"48","85","A more cunning man might have claimed that she had.","",""
"48","87","And that more cunning man would have been kicked off the premises.","",""
"48","88","The Countess doesn't do the lottery. ","",""
"48","89","What do you know about the Templars?","",""
"48","90","Who wants to know?","",""
"48","91","Are you angling for a bribe or something?","",""
"48","92","You have nothing that I want, señor, except the pleasure of your absence.","",""
"48","93","The guy was obviously protecting the Countess against the whole world. But why?","",""
"48","94","Okay. Well, I'll see you around..","",""
"48","95","Adiós!","",""
"48","96","I'll be going. For now.","",""
"48","97","Adiós, señor!","",""
"48","98","What do you make of this? ","",""
"48","99","So that's it. You're a salesman.","",""
"48","100","If I was hawking medical supplies I can think of better places to hawk them.","",""
"48","101","Look at this tissue.","",""
"48","102","It's a tissue with some greasy muck on it.","",""
"48","103","Yes, that's right.","",""
"48","104","There's a funny story about how I got this ball.","",""
"48","105","I don't want to hear it.","",""
"48","106","Do you recognize this matchbook?","",""
"48","107","I don't smoke.","",""
"48","109","No.","",""
"48","110","I don't suppose this red nose means anything to you, does it?","",""
"48","111","Ha! El Flojo!","",""
"48","112","El who?","",""
"48","113","El Flojo, he is a clown on state television.","",""
"48","114","Oh. Is he any good?","",""
"48","115","He is as funny as scabies. Without the laughs.","",""
"48","116","Do you recognize this man?","",""
"48","117","No.","",""
"48","118","Have you ever seen a lens like this before?","",""
"48","119","No, señor, never.","",""
"48","120","This lab pass mean anything to you?","",""
"48","121","Nothing.","",""
"48","122","Do you know what this is?","",""
"48","123","Si, I have a similar tool for opening culverts on the estate.","",""
"48","124","Would you like to shake hands?","",""
"48","125","I do not think so, señor.","",""
"48","126","See this gem? Men have died for it!","",""
"48","127","Do I look as if I care?","",""
"48","128","What do you think of this tripod?","",""
"48","129","I think nothing of it.","",""
"48","130","Señor Stobbart! You've... you've found something!","",""
"48","131","This is it! This is where we find the secret of the Templars...","",""
"48","132","Hidden here for hundreds of years...","",""
"48","133","Lost from the sight of man... until now!","",""
"48","134","The mystery is revealed!","",""
"48","135","It's a tin can!","",""
"48","136","I've been walking up and down with a twig in my hands looking for a TIN CAN?","",""
"48","137","It had water in it. That's what the dowsing stick must have detected.","",""
"48","138","I'd have to check with an archaeologist but I don't think the Templars left that. ","",""
"48","139","In truth, señor Stobbart. The lawn was laid many, many years ago.","",""
"48","140","This can could date back to the Napoleonic Wars!","",""
"48","142","Lopez threw the can away. It seemed to fall an awfully long way.","",""
"48","143","The splash at the end confirmed what we both suspected.","",""
"48","144","Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle!","",""
"48","145","It has been here all the time! All those years and nobody found it!","",""
"48","146","We stood in awe for a moment, marveling at the secrets all around us.","",""
"48","147","I could have fallen down that.","",""
"48","148","I'd been planning to return the chalice anyway...","",""
"48","149","...but I hadn't expected the trail to bring me here.","",""
"48","150","The Villa de Vasconcellos was as picturesque as ever, the weather was still clear...","",""
"48","151","...and Lopez was still watering the damned lawn.","",""
"48","152","I was beginning to suspect that he was surgically attached to that hose.","",""
"48","153","Hi there, Lopez! How's tricks?","",""
"48","154","Señor Stobbart! How pleasant to see you! You are well?","",""
"48","155","Fine, thanks. Is the Countess in?","",""
"48","156","She is waiting for you. I will show you up.","",""
"48","157","It's okay, I know the way.","",""
"48","158","Señor Stobbart. I feel I owe you...","",""
"48","159","...an apology","",""
"48","160","No, you don't.","",""
"48","161","I was impolite on our first meeting...","",""
"48","162","Look, Lopez, just forget about it. I came on like a snake oil merchant.","",""
"48","163","I wouldn't have trusted me in your shoes.","",""
"48","164","You do not understand. Finding the chalice has given my lady a new lease of life.","",""
"48","165","It's a marvel. She smiles. She laughs.","",""
"48","166","The tradesmen are saying that she is on Prozac.","",""
"48","167","He didn't hear me..","",""
"48","168","Hi, Lopez. Got a minute?","",""
"48","169","Certainly, señor. How can I help you?","",""
"48","170","He didn't hear me..","",""
"48","171","You must know just about everything that there is to know about this place.","",""
"48","172","Si. I have lived my whole life here in the service of the de Vasconcellos.","",""
"48","173","Do you know of a well anywhere around here?","",""
"48","174","A well? Si, señor. This used to be a fortified villa.","",""
"48","175","How can you last a siege without water?","",""
"48","176","Great! So where is it?","",""
"48","177","How should I know?","",""
"48","178","The well was covered over in the last century. It was dangerous, you see?","",""
"48","179","And you've no idea where it was?","",""
"48","180","None. It was hidden even before my grandfather's time. ","",""
"48","181","You must have a vague idea where the well is?","",""
"48","182","It must have been in the old house's courtyard so that would put it around here.","",""
"48","183","Here? Okay. How do we find it?","",""
"48","184","There might be a way. Let me think about it.","",""
"48","185","Any ideas yet?","",""
"48","186","We are looking for a source of water, si?","",""
"48","187","Yes?","",""
"48","188","For generations, the Spanish countryfolk have had a secret way of locating water...","",""
"48","189","...even if it is metres beneath the ground.","",""
"48","191","Eh?","",""
"48","192","You know. You get a stick and walk around until the stick twitches and dig there?","",""
"48","193","Oh. You've heard of it.","",""
"48","195","Uno momento. It must be a special stick. A `Y' of hazel!","",""
"48","197","¡Si! Here!","",""
"48","198","That is hazel!","",""
"48","199","Not as yet, señor Stobbart. I shall give it more thought.","",""
"48","200","It's really dark down there. Do you have a flashlight or something?","",""
"48","201","No, I broke my torch only last month.","",""
"48","202","Damn. It's so bright up here but the light's just not getting into the corners.","",""
"48","203","Si, the light, it goes in straight lines.","",""
"48","204","I can't find any usable branches on that hazel tree!","",""
"48","205","No? ¡Qué lata!","",""
"48","206","How am I supposed to find the well without a divining rod?","",""
"48","207","I have no idea, señor.","",""
"48","208","Oh, never mind.","",""
"48","209","So the Countess feels that the curse is lifted?","",""
"48","210","I would not put it so strongly.","",""
"48","211","Your discovery of the chalice was proof that the Templars never abandoned the de Vasconcellos.","",""
"48","212","It counts for a great deal with my lady.","",""
"48","213","What's the story behind the chalice vanishing?","",""
"48","214","When the Inquisition raided in the absence of Don Carlos, it was believed that they had taken it.","",""
"48","215","Naturally, they denied the charge as they denied taking the children.","",""
"48","216","And naturally, nobody believed them.","",""
"48","217","But they were telling the truth. The chalice was hidden from them.","",""
"48","218","You don't suppose they were telling the truth about the children as well, do you?","",""
"48","219","¡Madre Dios! I had not thought of that! But, then what happened to them?","",""
"48","220","I don't know. If the Inquisition didn't take them, then who did?","",""
"48","221","You must speak to my lady of this!","",""
"48","222","Count on it.","",""
"48","223","Catch you later, Lopez.","",""
"48","224","¡Adios, señor Stobbart!","",""
"48","225","Well, I got my divining rod. Now what?","",""
"48","226","Simplicity itself, sigñor. Hold the wand at the upper ends of the `Y'.","",""
"48","227","Apply a little tension with your wrists so that the slightest movement of the wand's tip is clear...","",""
"48","228","...and walk slowly and steadily over the area.","",""
"48","229","Sounds easy enough.","",""
"48","230","We'll find this well in no time!","",""
"48","231","Look at this tissue.","",""
"48","232","Why?","",""
"48","233","I'd like your opinion on it. ","",""
"48","234","Okay.","",""
"48","235","It has some sort of oily deposit on it.","",""
"48","236","That's greasepaint.","",""
"48","237","Oh? I wouldn't like that on my face.","",""
"48","238","It stinks of solvent. Stray spark and your head might blow up!","",""
"48","239","I don't think it's quite that flammable.","",""
"48","240","This tissue is charred.","",""
"48","241","You won't get any argument from me on that, señor Stobbart.","",""

"48","251","Si?","",""
"48","252","I would've expected Latin.","",""
"48","253","Be careful with it. It was a present to my lady from an old friend.","",""

"54","11","Yeah. Let's hope it was worth it.","",""
"54","12","Can't you sit still, George?","",""
"54","13","I need to go to the john.","",""

"54","16","Okay...","",""
"54","17","Where are you going, George?","",""
"54","18","Do I need to spell it out?","",""
"54","19","Don't snap at me! If you're going to take a leak why don't you say so?","",""
"54","20","Okay. I'm going to take a leak.","",""
"54","21","L - E - A - K.","",""
"54","22","Tickets, please!","",""
"54","23","Oh, hi...","",""
"54","24","That's a standard full-price peak return.","",""
"54","25","Don't you have a Senior Citizen's Rail Card?","",""
"54","26","I rarely travel by train.","",""
"54","27","My ticket is perfectly valid, is it not?","",""
"54","28","Well... yeah. But you could've saved up to a third of the cost!","",""
"54","29","I do not need to indulge in piffling thriftiness.","",""
"54","30","Blimey - you're a funny ol' bird, an' no mistake!","",""
"54","31","Tickets, please, sir.","",""
"54","32","Here...","",""
"54","33","Off to Stirling, eh?","",""
"54","34","Yes, we are.","",""
"54","35","Well, I hope you won't be disappointed.","",""
"54","36","It's a miserable place this time o' year.","",""
"54","37","Still, there's plenty o' pubs, and a luverly view from the castle!","",""
"54","38","Thank you.","",""
"54","39","I don't want to worry you, but there was something familiar about that guy.","",""
"54","40","Are you sure? You're tired. Perhaps you're mistaken?","",""
"54","41","Maybe. But I didn't like the look in his eyes when he spoke to you...","",""
"54","42","I've just seen Guido, the gangster.","",""
"54","43","Was that the guy I flattened in the museum?","",""
"54","44","Yeah, that's him.","",""
"54","45","Did he see you?","",""
"54","46","Oh, yes.","",""
"54","47","What shall we do about Guido?","",""
"54","48","Leave him be. He's not likely to start anything while we're on the train, is he?","",""
"54","49","No? I wouldn't bet on it.","",""
"54","50","There's something I've been meaning to say to you, Nico.","",""
"54","51","Is this the right time and place, George?","",""
"54","52","There might not be another time. I don't want to waste this chance.","",""
"54","53","You don't need to say anything.","",""
"54","54","I wouldn't want to be anywhere else but here with you now.","",""
"54","55","You're exhausted. Why don't you try to get some sleep?","",""
"54","56","Sleep? At a time like this?","",""
"54","57","Excited, huh?","",""
"54","59","Would you like something to help you sleep, dearie?","",""

"54","61","Oh... no - thank you.","",""
"54","62","Thanks all the same, ma'am.","",""
"54","63","Hard to believe that this thing saved my life.","",""
"54","64","I'll buy you a new one when we get back. ","",""
"54","65","This thing has got me out of a few scrapes. ","",""
"54","66","Maybe I should get one. ","",""
"54","67","I've still got the clown's nose...","",""
"54","68","So I see. You should throw it away, George.","",""
"54","69","I wonder where Khan is now.","",""
"54","70","Forget about him. He must be miles away. ","",""
"54","71","I wonder if there ever was a Thomas Moerlin?","",""
"54","72","Didn't I tell you? I checked. There wasn't.","",""
"54","73","Do you want to look after this ticket?","",""
"54","74","Not me! I don't want to get involved with a British Railways official!","",""
"54","75","Pardon me...","",""
"54","76","She must be deaf...","",""
"54","77","Yes, my dear?","",""

"54","79","A quarter to six, but we're running eight minutes late.","",""
"54","80","Yes, dear?","",""
"54","81","Do you know Stirling well?","",""
"54","82","Yes, I do.","",""
"54","83","Is that where you two lovebirds are bound?","",""
"54","84","Yeah, we...","",""
"54","85","It's one of the places we thought we'd see on our holiday.","",""
"54","86","Be sure to visit the castle, won't you?","",""
"54","87","I'm sure it's a neat place, but we're not really interested in history - are we, George?","",""
"54","88","Uh... no.","",""
"54","90","That's right. There's nothing George enjoys more than a good boogie.","",""
"54","91","Is there a church called St. Ninians at Stirling?","",""
"54","92","Yes, there is, and I know why you're going there!","",""
"54","93","You do?","",""
"54","94","Of course I do. It's obvious you're in love...","",""
"54","95","You're eloping! And they say Romance is dead...!","",""
"54","96","What's the book you're reading?","",""
"54","97","Oh, it's something I picked up at the station.","",""
"54","98","A medieval detective story. Quite well written for that kind of thing.","",""
"54","99","It's been out of print for years.","",""
"54","100","What's the title of the book?","",""
"54","101","`The Crooked Crusader Caper' by Molly Peagram.","",""
"54","102","I assumed the author was a woman, but apparently not.","",""
"54","103","His real name is...","",""
"54","104","Professor Nigel Peagram.","",""
"54","105","That's right! Do you know him?","",""
"54","106","No. I never met him.","",""
"54","107","George is a great fan of his, though.","",""
"54","108","Would you believe that this clown's nose led to us being on this train tonight?","",""
"54","109","I would indeed.","",""
"54","110","No, honestly, it... you would?","",""
"54","111","Certainly. You have an honest face.","",""
"54","112","Yep, that's a nose with a history, all right.","",""
"54","113","So you said.","",""
"54","114","Have you ever seen this man before?","",""
"54","115","An interesting looking fellow.","",""
"54","116","Interesting? He's a killer!","",""
"54","117","And that's not interesting?","",""
"54","118","You really think this guy looks interesting?","",""
"54","119","He looks like a driven man. ","",""
"54","120","Does the name `Moerlin' mean anything to you?","",""
"54","121","Merlin, a master of illusions. ","",""
"54","122","Oh, you said `Moerlin'? Then no, nothing.","",""
"54","124","A manhole lifting key.","",""
"54","125","You knew that?","",""
"54","126","Of course, I never leave home without one.","",""
"54","127","You're joking?","",""
"54","128","What use would an old lady have for such a thing?","",""
"54","129","Seriously, how did you recognize this?","",""
"54","130","I've had a full life.","",""
"54","131","Do you know what this is? ","",""
"54","132","Yes, I do.","",""
"54","133","A young friend of mine shook my hand with one just the other day.","",""
"54","134","Yeah? That's outrageous! He should be shot!","",""
"54","135","Perhaps. Still, his intentions were good.","",""
"54","136","I'm sorry that you've been zapped by one of these things.","",""
"54","137","You shouldn't be.","",""
"54","138","Have you ever seen anything like this before?","",""
"54","139","I suppose `espresso bars' and `boogie-woogie' are more your cup of tea!","",""
"55","1","The window seemed to have been sprayed with tiny flecks of froth.","",""
"55","2","The window was wide open to the freezing night air.","",""
"55","3","The man's face was blotched and unshaven. I guess he'd been traveling all night.","",""
"55","4","Red-rimmed eyes stared fish-like above his broken nose.","",""
"55","5","All I could see of the man's face was a massive purple bruise around his eye.","",""
"55","6","It was a strange contrast with his flaming red hair which stuck out in stiff greasy tufts.","",""
"55","7","I didn't want to wake him. ","",""
"55","8","To be frank, without a cold water hose I didn't think I COULD wake him. ","",""
"55","9","He was so drunk he didn't hear me...","",""
"55","10","Divvn't open that window, pal!","",""
"55","11","Why not?","",""

"55","69","Hey, thars look right wicked!","",""
"55","70","It's not a weapon.","",""
"55","71","Well, naa, but you have to be flexible, like.","",""
"55","72","Do you know what this is?","",""
"55","73","Nah, mon, what is it?","",""
"55","74","It's a hand buzzer.","",""
"55","75","You won't catch me out with that, pal!","",""

"55","77","Well, maybe youse might, pal, like a clever double bluff, y'knaa?","",""
"55","78","You just tek it from me, pal - you're in safe hands.","",""
"55","79","I don't recall the British Army being involved in a conflict at anywhere called Brightlingsea...?","",""
"56","1","No! I had to think fast!","",""
"56","2","It was the signaling device which alerted the driver to make an emergency stop.","",""
"56","3","The fine for improper use was fifty English pounds.","",""
"56","4","I wondered if the authorities would consider this sufficient reason for stopping the train...","",""
"56","5","I'd always wanted to stop a train, and now was my chance!","",""
"56","6","I'd already used the brake to bring the train to a halt.","",""
"56","7","I figured I'd stand a slim chance of escape if I moved fast enough...","",""
"56","8","But I couldn't leave Nico to Eklund's mercy.","",""
"56","9","The Assassin was badly wounded, but still conscious.","",""
"56","10","Somehow, despite the cosmetics and the old lady's clothes, the Assassin managed to retain his dignity.","",""
"56","11","He was the most dignified cross-dresser I'd ever known.","",""
"56","12","The guy was a professional killer; the last thing he deserved was sympathy.","",""
"56","13","I had to admit it though - I was sorry he'd ended up this way.","",""
"56","14","Underneath that heap of tumbled crates was Eklund. I wasn't about to help him out.","",""
"56","15","Nico looked good - even in ropes. ","",""
"56","16","Nico didn't look like somebody who'd just been tied up...","",""
"56","17","...and threatened by a killer ticket inspector. ","",""
"56","20","The rear exit was barred and padlocked.","",""
"56","21","There was no way I could open it. ","",""
"56","22","The head of the axe glinted invitingly... I could hack Eklund into tiny pieces and feed him to the wolves!","",""
"56","23","I still thought it a good idea to take the axe to Eklund while he was down...","",""
"56","24","I knew killing came easily to Eklund. ","",""
"56","25","It was a fire extinguisher.","",""
"56","26","The extinguisher might have been useful to distract Eklund, but I couldn't reach it.","",""
"56","27","I couldn't think of a single way the extinguisher would be of use in the absence of a fire.","",""
"56","28","Can't you do anything to help me?","",""
"56","29","You saved our lives! But why?","",""
"56","30","We were always on the same side, Stobbart.","",""
"56","31","Different causes, but a common enemy.","",""
"56","32","The Knights Templar?","",""
"56","33","Don't call them that! The real Templars were a noble foe.","",""
"56","34","These... barbarians have no right to that name.","",""
"56","35","These men are no better than dogs!","",""
"56","36","What are the Neo-Templars after?","",""
"56","37","What is the Sword of Baphomet?","",""
"56","38","Not what you think, my friend.","",""
"56","39","It is a weapon, yes, but one which our enemies will find difficult to wield.","",""
"56","40","A double-edged sword - a power older than de Molay, older than Solomon!","",""
"56","41","We'll stop them! You and me together...!","",""
"56","42","...and Nico.","",""
"56","43","No, George. My journey ends soon, at the garden of Paradise.","",""
"56","44","You're talking in riddles! Can't you tell me straight what they're after?","",""
"56","45","The Sword symbolises a colossal energy....","",""
"56","47","Which are focused at St Ninians!","",""
"56","48","The energy endowed the Templars with the power which made them great.","",""
"56","49","A power which made them charismatic to such an extent...","",""
"56","50","...they could control the will of all around them.","",""
"56","51","How did you escape from the Bull's Head?","",""
"56","52","It is a long walk from the cliff of the Bull to the village, Stobbart.","",""
"56","53","Fortunately, I know the ways of the wilderness.","",""
"56","54","Also, I have a sister who keeps a garage just around the corner.","",""
"56","56","May Allah guide you...","",""
"56","57","...to our enemies.","",""
"56","58","Thanks.","",""
"56","59","One last thing...!","",""
"56","60","What? What is it?","",""
"56","61","He's dead.","",""
"56","64","Don't worry, Nico. I'll have us out of here in no time!","",""
"56","65","She didn't hear me...","",""
"56","66","Don't even think about it, George!","",""
"56","67","What? Who?","",""
"56","68","Look me straight in the eye and tell me you weren't thinking of using that axe on Eklund.","",""
"56","69","Don't be foolish, woman.","",""
"56","70","I was going to use it on you.","",""
"56","71","Aw, come on! You think I'd kill a man in cold blood?","",""
"56","72","Of course not. I just don't trust you not to cut your own stupid foot off.","",""
"56","73","Where do you think you're going?","",""
"56","74","Don't worry. I hadn't forgotten about you.","",""
"56","75","Untie me this instant, George Stobbart.","",""
"56","76","I will... when I'm ready. ","",""
"56","77","That's not fair, George.","",""
"56","78","No.","",""
"56","79","You took advantage while my hands were tied.","",""
"56","80","When Eklund pointed that gun at me, I thought I was going to die.","",""
"56","81","I thought of all the things I'd never get to do...","",""
"56","82","And kissing you was top of my list.","",""
"56","83","George...","",""
"56","84","Uh-huh?","",""
"56","85","George - we've got to get off the train.","",""
"56","86","Eklund could recover at any time.","",""
"56","87","So what are we waiting for?","",""
"56","88","What are you doing?!","",""
"56","89","I'm out of here...","",""
"56","90","Not that door! Do you want to end up like Flap?","",""
"56","91","Not especially. What remains of him is well on its way back to London...","",""
"56","92","I hope he was travelling on a return ticket.","",""
"56","93","Nico...?","",""
"56","94","What now?","",""
"56","95","How are you feeling?","",""
"56","96","How would you feel if you'd been tied up and humiliated?","",""
"56","97","Don't worry - Eklund isn't going to cause any problems for a little while.","",""
"56","98","I wasn't talking about Eklund.","",""
"56","99","Oh, now listen...","",""
"56","100","I don't want to talk about it.","",""
"56","101","You took advantage of me, George Stobbart.","",""
"56","102","Are you mad at me because of one little kiss?","",""
"56","103","Little? You've got a tongue like a horse!","",""
"56","104","You're such a sweet talker, Nico.","",""
"56","105","What do you think about...","",""
"56","106","George! We don't have time for that! ","",""
"56","107","What do you think about...","",""
"56","108","George! We don't have time for that! ","",""
"56","109","What do you think about...","",""
"56","110","George! We don't have time for that! ","",""
"56","111","What do you think about...","",""
"56","112","George! We don't have time for that! ","",""
"56","113","What do you think about...","",""
"56","114","George! We don't have time for that! ","",""
"56","115","What do you think about...","",""
"56","116","George! We don't have time for that! ","",""
"56","117","Let's talk this over like reasonable people, Eklund.","",""
"56","118","I can explain everything...","",""
"56","119","Okay - you win. You can have the manuscript.","",""
"56","120","...caused by a conjunction of the earth's natural power fields.","",""
"56","121","Hmm... Maybe not.","",""
"57","1","It was just about recognizable as the church I'd seen reflected in the chalice. ","",""
"57","2","Templars, Roundheads and Cavaliers. ","",""
"57","3","This place had seen a lot of history. ","",""
"57","4","A large arch led into the tower.  ","",""
"57","5","There were lots of graves, some as recent as late Victorian. ","",""
"57","6","It looked like the locals had carried on using this place as a cemetary...","",""
"57","7","...long after the destruction of the church. ","",""
"57","8","I figured Scotland had had enough trouble with Burke and Hare...","",""
"57","9","...without me trying my hand at grave robbing. ","",""
"57","10","The gate, like a lot of the church grounds, was in pretty good condition","",""
"57","11","I guess the locals tried to stop it getting too overgrown. ","",""
"57","12","No way were we leaving until the mystery was solved.","",""
"58","1","It was a simple cog arrangement with a handle to turn the larger wheel.","",""
"58","2","Without the handle the small cog and spindle were seemingly useless.","",""
"58","3","It was a support for the dismantled winding cog.","",""
"58","4","The handle turned easily and the larger wheel began to revolve...","",""
"58","5","Damn!","",""
"58","6","Then the handle came off in my hand. ","",""
"58","7","Now that the handle was gone it was easy to remove the cog and spindle.","",""
"58","8","There was no way of reconnecting the handle to the cog except by welding it.","",""
"58","9","There was no place I could attach the broken handle.","",""
"58","10","I placed the cog and spindle back in the supporting frame.","",""
"58","11","The wheel had a serrated edge which meshed with the turning cog.","",""
"58","12","Marks on the spindle behind the wheel suggested it once had a rope attached to it.","",""
"58","13","The wheel turned reluctantly with a creak of complaint.","",""
"58","14","There was no obvious way of removing the wheel from its housing.","",""
"58","15","The stone face of the demon grinned with a horribly life like expression.","",""
"58","16","It was so realistic, I could imagine the sculptor carving it from a live model.","",""
"58","17","That grinning face was beginning to unsettle my nerves.","",""
"58","18","With one of his eyes in place, the demon looked even more disturbing than before.","",""
"58","19","The demon's face was complete, and the effect chilled me to the bone.","",""
"58","20","The medieval world must have been a fearsome place to inspire nightmares like this.","",""
"58","21","The pipe helped a lot - he looked almost human - but I felt there was something lacking...","",""
"58","25","The nose was a great improvement, except that now he reminded me of my dentist...","",""
"58","26","Examining the demon more closely, I realized something about its face.","",""
"58","27","It was a clever illusion - no matter where I stood, the eyes weren't looking at me.","",""
"58","28","There was a simple reason: the demon didn't have any eyes.","",""
"58","29","I ran my fingers across the cold stone and probed the holes in the demon's eyes. ","",""
"58","30","Beneath them the mouth formed another hole - but I wasn't about to put my finger in there.","",""
"58","31","The cog turned freely, but nothing happened.","",""
"58","32","I tried turning the cogs but couldn't move them. I needed a mechanical advantage. ","",""
"58","33","I pushed the handle into the demon's mouth - the cogs all meshed. I began to turn...","",""
"58","34","The cog slipped neatly into the eye socket.","",""
"58","35","With a rasp of metal on stone I eased the second eye into place.","",""
"58","36","With the clay pipe in his mouth he looked happy, homely, like somebody's grand-daddy.","",""
"58","37","Sometimes the most childish gestures can have a cathartic effect...","",""
"58","38","The transformation of the demon to a clown did just that for me.","",""

"58","42","It was a heap of stones and stuff which had tumbled down from the rafters.","",""
"58","43","I scrabbled around in the rubble and found an old clay pipe with a broken stem.","",""
"58","44","Under one of the stones I found a metal coin which was green with age.","",""
"58","45","It was caked with soil, but what I'd found was a small cog and spindle.","",""
"58","46","With mounting excitement I felt something between my fingers.","",""
"58","47","It was short, hard and black, something I hadn't expected to find here...","",""
"58","48","It was a plastic pen top.","",""
"58","49","I didn't find anything.","",""
"58","50","Above the carved cross was an indecipherable inscription.","",""

"59","5","But Nico's temper was likely to flare up again. Now that scared me!","",""
"59","6","The powder spilling from the barrels reminded me of pirate stories I'd loved when I was a kid.","",""
"59","7","It was gunpowder.","",""
"59","8","It was definitely gunpowder, but it had solidified over the centuries it had lain here undisturbed.","",""

"60","2","Baphomet! Lobineau was right, this place was ancient even to the Templars!","",""

"60","4","Finally, the truth.","",""
"60","5","The Templars had never worshipped this graven image, no more than they'd worship a rainbow.","",""

"63","110","Without André we wouldn't have got this far, George.","",""
"63","111","Yeah, I know.","",""

"63","113","The Templars had left a tapestry, showing a chess board.","",""
"63","114","The white pieces were vastly outnumbered.","",""
"63","115","There was a stream running across the board, and a Templar knight on a horse.","",""
"63","116","Does it mean anything to you, André?","",""
"63","117","No... nothing.","",""
"63","118","Maybe we should tell André what else you found, George.","",""
"63","119","There's a map and a Latin inscription...","",""
"63","120","`To the West, at the edge of the world'.","",""
"63","121","George found that in a cave in Syria.","",""
"63","122","Yeah, where the Assassin almost killed me.","",""
"63","123","Then we've got the burning of Jacques de Molay, and the date: Thirteen-fourteen.","",""
"63","124","From the window of the church in Montfauçon Square.","",""
"63","125","One of the few places where nobody tried to kill me.","",""

"63","127","I don't recall anyone trying to kill you there either, George.","",""
"63","128","And finally we have the tapestry in Spain.","",""
"63","129","Did I mention I almost got killed there?","",""
"63","130","Not yet, but I'm sure you're about to...","",""
"63","131","It was only my cat-like reflexes that saved me from certain death!","",""
"63","132","Cat-like reflexes, eh?","",""
"63","133","And while I was risking life and limb where were you, André?","",""
"63","134","Getting your glasses fogged up over an Etruscan vase?","",""
"63","135","That's enough, boys. Can we get back to saving the world?","",""
"63","136","Of course. My apologies.","",""
"63","137","He started it.","",""
"63","138","Well, the Latin phrase are the words of Julius Caesar.","",""
"63","139","He was describing the Island of Britain.","",""
"63","140","Are you sure? The map didn't look much like Britain...","",""
"63","141","How come Caesar described Britain as being at the edge of the world?","",""
"63","142","To the Romans, the Mediterranean was the center of the universe.","",""
"63","143","Britain was a remote, unfriendly place, inhabited by blue-painted savages.","",""
"63","144","It hasn't changed much...","",""
"63","145","They've stopped painting themselves blue.","",""
"63","146","Except when they go to a football match...","",""
"63","147","They used an extract from a plant called woad - Isatis Tinctoia.","",""
"63","148","The Scots were using it until fairly recently in their wars with the English.","",""
"63","149","Fairly recently? I don't recall the Scots being at war with the English!","",""
"63","150","How recently are you talking about?","",""
"63","151","I believe William Wallace's men used it in the thirteenth century.","",""
"63","152","They might well have been using it as late as...","",""
"63","153","You can't remember, can you?","",""
"63","154","...Thirteen-fourteen!","",""
"63","155","Oh, we're back onto that, are we?","",""
"63","156","André, what is it? What do you mean?","",""
"63","157","Thirteen-fourteen. In Scotland.","",""
"63","158","The Battle of Bannockburn!","",""
"63","159","That would explain the stream on the chess board!","",""
"63","160","That's what a `burn' is! Right, André? As in `Bannockburn'?","",""
"63","161","Right, George. And it gets better...","",""
"63","162","Tradition has it that the Scots were helped by a shock force of... well, can't you guess? ","",""
"63","163","Knights Templar?","",""
"63","164","Yes, a group of outlawed Templars.","",""
"63","165","They are said to have turned the tide for the Scots.","",""
"63","166","And it all ends at a church.","",""
"63","167","In the Isle of Britain, at Bannockburn, in a church.","",""
"63","168","What are we waiting for?","",""
"63","169","I'll call a cab.","",""
"63","170","I can't go.","",""
"63","171","André - you've been loads of help, but...","",""
"63","172","What George is trying to say, is that you shouldn't feel guilty.","",""
"63","173","I was...?","",""
"63","174","We understand - you've got committments.","",""
"63","176","We'll see it through. Oh, and - don't worry about us.","",""
"63","177","Hi, Nico.","",""
"63","178","Hello, George.","",""
"63","179","I've found out what the chalice was for...!","",""
"63","180","You've solved the puzzle?","",""
"63","181","Yeah. There was a distorted picture at the Baphomet site.","",""
"63","182","When I viewed it in the polished surface of the chalice, it changed.","",""
"63","183","What did it show?","",""
"63","184","A picture of a church with a square tower...","",""
"63","185","Hi! How you doing?","",""
"63","186","Fine, George.","",""
"63","187","I sold a story this morning.","",""
"63","188","It won't make me journalist of the year, but I can afford to pay the electric bill...","",""

"63","200","Nico! I've seen them!","",""
"63","201","Who?","",""
"63","202","The Templars! I spied on their meeting in the catacombs!","",""
"63","203","And you saw the Knights Templar?","",""
"63","205","They're after something called the Sword of Baphomet.","",""
"63","206","The bogus doctor was there - the guy who killed Marquet.","",""
"63","207","The manuscript is the key, just as we thought.","",""
"63","208","It shows the way to the Broken Sword - whatever that is...","",""
"63","209","And how does the Assassin fit into all this?","",""
"63","210","He's out to stop them!","",""
"63","211","These neo-Templars - they're men and women in influential positions.","",""
"63","212","Don't you see? Plantard was one of them!","",""
"63","213","The Assassin killed him for the manuscript, to stop them finding the Sword.","",""
"63","214","But now we've got the manuscript!","",""
"63","215","Yeah.","",""
"63","216","So how do they hope to find the Sword?","",""
"63","217","I don't know.","",""
"63","218","They said something about a lens, and a guy called Klausner who's gone to Syria.","",""
"63","219","But they didn't seem to realize the significance of the very site of their meeting!","",""
"63","220","You see, after they'd gone, I discovered a stone pedestal and a carved inscription.","",""
"63","221","I set up the gem on the tripod, directly below a beam of light.","",""
"63","222","The gem split the beam, and lit the letters M-A-R-I-B.","",""

"63","227","These guys are crazy - and dangerous.","",""

"63","243","Poor George!","",""
"63","244","What a mess. I bungled the whole thing!","",""
"63","245","I don't think so. You made a pretty good job of distracting those two crooks...","",""
"63","246","Yeah, but the killer got away with the tripod!","",""
"63","247","No he didn't. He's not the only one who can dress up in costume...","",""
"63","248","You mean...?","",""
"63","250","Hell, Nico - I could have been shot!","",""
"63","251","Those dorks were more likely to shoot their own feet.","",""

"63","260","Nothing happened.","",""
"63","261","Yeah.","",""
"63","262","The gem fits perfectly, but what does that prove?","",""
"63","263","Maybe the tripod has to be in a certain location...","",""
"63","264","There's nothing on the manuscript to indicate where though, is there?","",""
"63","266","Hi, George.","",""
"63","267","I found Jacques Marquet.","",""

"63","277","Hi.","",""
"63","278","Hello, George.","",""
"63","279","I have to go to Spain.","",""

"63","285","Hi, Nico!","",""

"63","287","I'm full of the joys of the fall.","",""
"63","288","Tell me about Marquet.","",""
"63","289","I can't imagine why...","",""

"63","292","You've found him?","",""
"63","293","He's in a hospital, here in Paris.","",""
"63","294","I guess that was the killer's doing - to stop him meeting Peagram.","",""
"63","295","Maybe. Are you going to try to talk to Marquet?","",""
"63","296","What have I got to lose?","",""
"63","297","Plenty.","",""
"63","298","Hello, George.","",""
"63","299","So where did you stay last night?","",""

"63","301","That explains why you look so ill today. Did you get any sleep at all?","",""
"63","302","Not much. I had to share the room with another guy.","",""
"63","303","Did he snore?","",""
"63","304","Hardly - he was dead.","",""
"63","305","Then Leary woke me in the middle of the night to help bail out the cellar.","",""
"63","306","The cellar was flooded?","",""
"63","307","Yeah. Some idiot had left the faucet running...","",""

"63","315","I've been reading about Peagram - in this magazine...","",""
"63","316","The media got its claws on him.","",""
"63","317","Yeah. If I was his agent I'd get him to lose the pipe.","",""

"63","359","You're just not going to believe what I've found!","",""
"63","360","It's not another part of the clown's costume, is it?","",""
"63","361","It's a medieval manuscript.","",""
"63","362","Khan left it in the safe at the Ubu.","",""
"63","363","It's incredible! Is this what he took from Plantard?","",""
"63","364","It could be, which means it's worth enough to kill for...","",""
"63","365","Look there! Two guys on the same horse!","",""
"63","366","Yeah. Maybe they couldn't afford one each.","",""
"63","367","What of it?","",""
"63","368","Have you ever heard of the Knights Templar?","",""
"63","369","Their official seal was an image of two knights, sharing a horse!","",""
"63","370","Whatever this manuscript means, it's connected with the Templars.","",""
"63","371","How come you know about these Knights?","",""
"63","372","I learned about them while writing an article on the Crusades.","",""
"63","391","Jeez! So the treasure is hidden, waiting to be discovered?","",""
"63","392","If there ever was a treasure, it's been lost for six hundred years.","",""
"63","393","Anyway, we're supposed to be investigating a serial killer, not a medieval treasure trove...","",""
"63","394","But maybe that's what the clown and his accomplices are after.","",""
"63","395","Maybe this manuscript is the key!","",""
"63","396","You'd better leave it here for safe keeping.","",""
"63","397","Think about it, George. One guy's already died for it, as you said yourself.","",""
"63","398","Besides, that parchment is fragile.","",""
"63","399","Okay, okay - I'm convinced. You keep hold of it.","",""
"63","400","Hi. How are you?","",""
"63","401","Oh, hi. Come in, George.","",""
"63","402","I found the address of the hotel where Khan the killer stayed...","",""
"63","403","Yeah? Is he still there?","",""
"63","404","I'm not sure.","",""
"63","405","If he is, he's changed his name.","",""
"63","406","What do you think I should do next?","",""
"63","407","I think you should look for clues at the hotel.","",""
"63","408","I guess so.","",""
"63","409","Salut, George. What news?","",""
"63","410","I've been to the costume shop.","",""
"63","411","Yeah. I like it. What are you supposed to be?","",""
"63","412","I didn't hire a costume. These are my clothes, and you know it.","",""
"63","413","Did you ask about the clown?","",""
"63","414","Yeah. He used the name `Khan'...","",""
"63","415","He hired two costumes: the clown and a pixie.","",""
"63","416","Then we're one jump ahead of him...","",""
"63","417","How do you make that out?","",""
"63","419","Oh, god - don't let it be me!","",""
"63","420","I don't deserve to die at the hands of a pixie!","",""
"63","421","Don't be silly, George. That won't happen.","",""
"63","422","Oh, no?","",""
"63","423","No - because every time you see a pixie, you're going to run like hell.","",""
"63","425","I'm still looking for the clown.","",""
"63","426","Didn't you say the concierge gave you the number of his tailor?","",""
"63","427","That's right.","",""
"63","428","Well, why don't you call him?","",""
"63","429","Hello again.","",""
"63","430","Hi, George. Have you traced the clown any further?","",""
"63","431","No.","",""
"63","432","Did you phone the tailor who made his jacket?","",""
"63","433","Yeah...","",""
"63","434","He wasn't much help, though.","",""
"63","436","No, not yet.","",""
"63","437","You can call him from here.","",""

"63","441","Please - call me George.","",""
"63","442","Fine. I'm Nicole. Take a seat, George...","",""
"63","444","I've been exploring the sewers beneath the café.","",""
"63","445","I thought I could smell something bad.","",""
"63","446","The clown used the sewer to escape, and to change out of his costume.","",""
"63","447","I guess he was in a hurry. He left his jacket behind.","",""
"63","448","And?","",""
"63","449","I got his tailor's phone number.","",""
"63","450","What's more, I know where he hired the clown suit, too!","",""
"63","451","You had better luck than I did.","",""
"63","452","Luck, she said. Luck! Hard work, I'd call it.","",""
"63","453","What happened?","",""
"63","454","I took my photographs to the editor but he wasn't interested.","",""
"63","455","Can you believe it? He told me to drop the story.","",""
"63","456","But you're not about to do that...","",""
"63","457","Oh, no. I'm going to find out what's behind these killings.","",""
"63","458","You know what I think? It's a conspiracy!","",""
"63","459","The police in three different countries have kept very quiet about the murders.","",""
"63","460","The press don't connect them at all.","",""
"63","461","They blame them on `political, religious or militant minority extremists.'","",""
"63","462","That covers just about everyone...","",""
"63","463","Hi. It's me again.","",""
"63","464","So I see.","",""
"63","465","Oh, by the way - I had a visit from André Lobineau.","",""
"63","466","Oh, yeah. I hope you didn't mind me giving him your address...","",""
"63","467","Not at all. It was lovely to see him again...","",""
"63","468","He was over the moon when I showed him the manuscript.","",""
"63","469","It's not often he gets that excited...","",""
"63","470","He made a sketch of the Knight's crest to take back to the museum.","",""
"63","471","I believe he's identified the family who bear that crest...","",""
"63","472","I sure hope so.","",""
"63","473","Hi! My name's George Stobbart...","",""
"63","474","Oh. An American, by the sound of it.","",""
"63","475","Yeah. That's right. On holiday in Paris.","",""
"63","476","Some holiday, huh?","",""
"63","477","You were here when the bomb went off?","",""
"63","478","Sure was! Sat right out front of the café!","",""
"63","479","Did you notice a middle-aged man, maybe sixty, with a hat and overcoat?","",""
"63","480","I couldn't believe it. She hadn't even asked how I was feeling...","",""
"63","481","Yeah. He went inside, just before the bomb exploded.","",""
"63","482","You weren't... related to him were you?","",""
"63","483","Oh, no - nothing like that.","",""
"63","484","I'm Nicole Collard, from 'La Liberté'.","",""
"63","485","What is that - some kind of nightclub?","",""
"63","486","Ah, no - it's a newspaper.","",""
"63","487","You're a reporter?","",""
"63","488","I'm a freelance photo-journalist.","",""
"63","490","You know, an eye-witness account...","",""
"63","491","`Minutes after the outrage that shook the whole of Paris...'","",""
"63","492","You know - real life drama, human interest - that kind of stuff.","",""
"63","493","I'll just stick to the facts, thank you.","",""
"63","494","Did you see who planted the bomb?","",""
"63","496","Oh, god. It's him again...","",""
"63","497","What is it?","",""
"63","498","Have you found out any more about the Knights Templar?","",""
"63","499","Yes, I have.","",""
"63","501","Otherwise known as Philip le bel.","",""
"63","502","I've heard of him.","",""
"63","503","I saw some coins from his realm at the Musée Crune.","",""
"63","504","Well, he's known to history as Philip the fair, but I doubt if the Templars called him that!","",""
"63","505","I'm sure André will tell you all about him.","",""
"63","506","Do you know a police officer called Rosso?","",""
"63","507","Rosso? Our paths have a knack of crossing.","",""
"63","508","If I didn't know better I'd say it was deliberate.","",""
"63","509","Have you seen Rosso? Is he here?","",""
"63","510","He's inside, attempting to question a witness with his psychic powers!","",""
"63","511","What? That guy is weird!","",""
"63","512","Yeah.","",""
"63","513","Rosso didn't blink when I told him about the clown.","",""
"63","514","It's as if he already knew...","",""
"63","515","That's typical of a cold fish like Rosso.","",""
"63","516","I've seen cheeseburgers with more spunk.","",""
"63","517","I didn't tell Rosso about the clown...","",""
"63","518","Why not? Did you think he wouldn't believe you?","",""
"63","519","It didn't seem appropriate, somehow.","",""
"63","520","But the waitress told him anyhow.","",""
"63","521","How did Rosso react?","",""
"63","522","I'm not sure whether he was surprised or not.","",""
"63","523","He's strange. Kind of... inscrutable.","",""
"63","525","You speak very good English for a French girl...","",""
"63","526","Thanks. You speak very good English for an American.","",""
"63","527","Tell me more about yourself...","",""
"63","528","Oh, there's not much to tell...","",""
"63","529","Well, how did you get into photography?","",""
"63","530","I guess I owe that to my father. He bought me my first camera.","",""
"63","531","I was eight and my parents had just split up.","",""
"63","532","Did you live with your father?","",""
"63","533","Yes. My mother went off with her new boyfriend.","",""
"63","534","I didn't mind. Papa was all I needed.","",""
"63","535","Four years later he died in a plane crash.","",""
"63","536","Oh - I'm sorry.","",""
"63","537","It's all right; I don't mind talking about him.","",""
"63","538","He was more like an older brother, really - always joking and laughing.","",""
"63","539","Papa always wanted I should study art. That's why I went to college.","",""
"63","540","Did you learn about photography at college?","",""
"63","541","God, no - I couldn't afford the materials.","",""
"63","542","We were billed for everything we used: paint, canvas, paper...","",""
"63","543","Most of my year turned to minimalism - it was cheaper.","",""
"63","544","I used to go poaching in the park for squirrel hair.","",""
"63","545","The only time I wasn't hungry was the term I did printing...","",""
"63","546","I used to eat the potatoes.","",""
"63","547","You're making fun of me, aren't you?","",""
"63","548","Oh, no!","",""
"63","549","Do you have a boyfriend?","",""
"63","550","That's none of your business.","",""
"63","551","Not any more...","",""
"63","552","There was someone - a guy in my final year - but it didn't work out.","",""
"63","553","Neither did my degree.","",""
"63","554","I'm sorry...","",""
"63","555","I'm not.","",""
"63","556","Tell me more about your family...","",""
"63","557","When I was a little girl, I used to spend the winter with my grandfather and grandma.","",""
"63","558","They were the best times, warm and safe in their tiny cottage...","",""
"63","559","My grandfather rolled cigarettes while grandma made hot chocolate and cakes.","",""
"63","560","One day he stopped his rolling, put the lid back on his tobacco jar, and took me in his arms.","",""
"63","561","I laughed and wriggled, but he hushed me to be silent.","",""
"63","563","What did he say?","",""
"63","564","He said: 'I don't smoke, but she likes to think I do.'","",""
"63","565","What a weird old man!","",""
"63","566","Don't call my grandfather weird! He was the nicest guy ever!","",""
"63","567","I wish I was back in that cottage, instead of this crummy apartment in this noisy city...","",""
"63","568","Who was the guy you were supposed to meet?","",""
"63","569","His name was Plantard. I didn't know him, but he called me last night.","",""
"63","570","He said he had a story which would interest me.","",""
"63","571","He asked me to meet him at the café.","",""
"63","572","I guess I'll never know what he wanted to tell me...","",""
"63","573","Not unless you have Rosso's gift for psychic interrogation.","",""
"63","574","How did Plantard get your name?","",""
"63","575","Through the newspaper - La Liberté.","",""
"63","576","I'd written an article linking two unsolved murders, one in Italy, the other in Japan.","",""
"63","577","The cases were remarkably similar...","",""
"63","578","...a wealthy victim, no apparent motive, and a costumed killer.","",""
"63","579","Plantard said he could supply me with more information.","",""
"63","580","Somehow, the clown must have known about our appointment!","",""
"63","581","I found Plantard's briefcase in the killer's hotel room.","",""
"63","582","It was empty, of course.","",""
"63","583","Have you met the clown before?","",""
"63","584","It's... a long story.","",""
"63","585","I have plenty of time.","",""
"63","586","I don't.","",""
"63","587","Why won't you tell me about this clown?","",""
"63","588","Why do you want to get involved?","",""
"63","589","Because he almost killed me! Isn't that reason enough?","",""
"63","590","I guess so. Listen...","",""
"63","591","I'll give you my phone number.","",""
"63","592","You help me with my story, and I'll let you in on what I know.","",""
"63","593","And let's get one thing straight right now...","",""
"63","594","This is strictly business.","",""
"63","595","Okay. It's a deal.","",""
"63","596","I have to go develop these pictures. À bientôt, m'sieur...","",""
"63","597","Fine. I'll, uh... see you soon.","",""
"63","598","Tell me more about the clown's previous victims.","",""
"63","599","The first was Arno Bilotta, the millionaire pharmaceutical baron.","",""
"63","600","He made his money from amphetamines, in the post-war slimming and diet boom.","",""
"63","601","Imagine it! Millions of housewives, literally speeding their butts off!","",""
"63","602","Was he killed for his money?","",""
"63","603","No. He had no living relatives, and his fortune went to the orphanage where he'd grown up.","",""
"63","604","The only witness in the case was his Filipino au pair.","",""
"63","605","She swears he was lured to his death by a snowman.","",""
"63","606","What about the clown's second victim?","",""
"63","607","Yamada, the controversial Japanese Green politician.","",""
"63","608","He inherited his fortune from his father's electro-chemical consortium.","",""
"63","609","He was committed to dismantling Japan's automobile industry.","",""
"63","610","I can't see him gaining much support with a loony policy like that!","",""
"63","611","Yamada was a man of vision. He was years ahead of his time.","",""
"63","612","If you say so. How did he die?","",""
"63","613","At the hands - or should I say, flippers - of a giant Emperor Penguin.","",""
"63","614","A snowman, a penguin, and now a clown...","",""
"63","615","You know, I hate to admit it, but this is scary...","",""
"63","617","I don't blame you for being scared - I am too.","",""
"63","618","But this story could be my only chance of a big break...","",""
"63","619","Or a premature death.","",""
"63","621","Let's face it - we need help, George.","",""
"63","622","Someone who knows about these things...","",""
"63","623","Who do you suggest - Indiana Jones?","",""
"63","624","I know a guy who specializes in medieval studies.","",""
"63","625","His name is Lobineau.","",""
"63","626","Huh! Some stuffy old fossil who gets horny over ancient relics, I suppose.","",""
"63","627","Far from it. André isn't the stereotypical professor you have in mind.","",""
"63","628","Where can I find this Lobineau guy?","",""
"63","629","At the Crune museum. I'll give you the address.","",""
"63","630","Let's take another look at the manuscript...","",""
"63","631","What do you know about Professor Peagram?","",""
"63","632","I've seen his television program - Peagram's Past.","",""
"63","633","He's written a book: `The Crusader families of Ireland'.","",""
"63","634","I'll bet he'd be interested in the manuscript!","",""
"63","636","I guess not.","",""
"63","637","He wants to come over. Shall I give him your address?","",""
"63","638","Yes. That's fine.","",""
"63","639","Maybe he'll make sense of the manuscript.","",""
"63","640","The guy at the museum identified the Knight's crest!","",""
"63","641","That's great news. I knew Lobineau would be likely to help. Tell me more...","",""
"63","642","It belongs to a Spanish family.","",""
"63","643","With Templar connections, no doubt?","",""
"63","644","That's one of the questions I want to ask them... if the family still exists.","",""
"63","645","Just how long have you known Lobineau?","",""
"63","646","André? We met at college.","",""
"63","647","He helped me out when I was a fresher - showed me round, that sort of thing.","",""
"63","648","You never told me that before!","",""
"63","649","I thought he was just a...a working acquaintance!","",""
"63","650","So he is. I rarely see him these days.","",""
"63","651","You know, he hasn't changed much - a little less hair at the front, perhaps.","",""
"63","652","I'd forgotten how much fun he could be.","",""
"63","653","Is there something going on between you and Lobineau?","",""
"63","654","What business is it of yours?","",""
"63","655","We agreed; all this - the Clown, the Templars - strictly business, remember?","",""
"63","656","Yeah, but...","",""
"63","657","So get off my case!","",""
"63","659","No, I haven't.","",""
"63","660","What are you doing to help trace the killer clown?","",""
"63","661","Research, George.","",""
"63","662","Yeah? You have a copy of the Clowns' Yearbook?","",""
"63","663","I have a telephone and a lot of contacts.","",""
"63","664","Oh. Well, did you find anything useful?","",""
"63","665","Not yet. I'm employing my first and most useful weapon...","",""
"63","666","What's that?","",""
"63","667","Patience.","",""
"63","668","I've heard of that. Isn't it a substitute for decisive thinking?","",""
"63","669","Have you found out any more about the murders?","",""
"63","670","Well, it may be nothing, but both the clown's victims visited Paris earlier this year...","",""
"63","671","When?","",""
"63","672","The second week of July. They were both here at the same time.","",""
"63","673","Did they meet?","",""
"63","674","I don't know, but I can't imagine it was coincidence.","",""
"63","675","Do you think the Assassin was responsible for killing Marquet?","",""
"63","676","I don't think so. He could have finished him off the first time.","",""
"63","677","Besides, Marquet would have recognized him.","",""
"63","678","He was pumped to the gills with sedatives.","",""
"63","679","He wouldn't have recognized the four horsemen of the Apocalypse unless they introduced themselves.","",""
"63","680","Have you ever heard of the Hashy-ashin?","",""
"63","681","No.","",""
"63","682","Marquet said that they were his biggest enemy.","",""
"63","683","His biggest enemy was the bogus doctor.","",""
"63","684","Don't remind me! That guy was evil.","",""
"63","685","He had wild, staring eyes, like a dead fish...","",""
"63","686","I'll never trust a doctor again...","",""
"63","688","Yeah?","",""
"63","689","The Cult of the Assassins.","",""
"63","690","Oh, boy.","",""
"63","691","May I use your telephone?","",""
"63","692","Sure - go ahead.","",""
"63","693","Thanks.","",""
"63","694","I guess I'd better return the chalice to the Countess...","",""
"63","695","Hurry back, George.","",""
"63","696","I'll be back as soon as I can...","",""
"63","697","Okay.","",""
"63","698","Do you think I should go to Marib...?","",""
"63","699","Syria is a long way, George.","",""
"63","700","I have to go.","",""
"63","701","Already? You only just arrived!","",""
"63","702","Time and tide wait for no man.","",""
"63","703","Okay. I'll see you later...","",""
"63","704","I'd better get back to the quest...","",""
"63","705","Can't you relax for a while?","",""
"63","706","I'd like to, but...","",""
"63","707","You're not ready to settle down yet?","",""
"63","708","We're burnin' daylight...","",""
"63","709","So long!","",""
"63","710","Okay. Goodbye.","",""
"63","711","I guess I better go back and talk to that weirdo.","",""
"63","712","Which one? Rosso, or Sergeant Moue? Or were you referring to André?","",""
"63","714","I have to go.","",""
"63","715","Okay. Good luck.","",""
"63","716","See you soon.","",""
"63","717","Yeah - see you.","",""
"63","718","I can't sit here all day, much as I'd like to...","",""
"63","719","Okay. Don't forget to look for Lobineau at the Crune Museum.","",""
"63","720","And why don't you see if Rosso has heard anything?","",""
"63","721","Okay. Anything else I can do for you while I'm out?","",""
"63","722","Shopping? A trip to the laundromat?","",""
"63","723","Just take care of yourself.","",""
"63","724","I'll see you again soon...","",""
"63","725","Okay.","",""
"63","726","Maybe I'll check out the Crune Museum...","",""
"63","727","I'm sure you'll find it useful, George.","",""

"63","729","Okay. Keep me informed if you find anything new.","",""
"63","730","I'd better get back to searching for that clown.","",""
"63","731","Okay. I'm going to research the Knights Templar.","",""
"63","732","See you later.","",""
"63","733","Where are you going now?","",""
"63","734","I could go back to the Hotel Ubu I guess...","",""

"63","737","Watch out for Khan, George.","",""
"63","738","Don't worry - I will.","",""
"63","739","Time for me to go. Thanks for your hospitality.","",""
"63","740","You're welcome.","",""
"63","743","I'm going back out to search for that clown...","",""
"63","744","Where?","",""
"63","745","I guess I could visit the costume shop.","",""
"63","746","Good idea.","",""
"63","747","I could go back to the costume shop...","",""
"63","748","Or maybe I should go look for Rosso.","",""
"63","749","Let me know if you find anything.","",""
"63","750","I will.","",""
"63","751","I don't know. Maybe there's something I've overlooked...","",""

"63","757","See you again, I hope.","",""
"63","758","Adieu, m'sieur.","",""
"63","759","Later, George.","",""
"63","760","I found this newspaper outside the café.","",""
"63","761","That's not a newspaper - it's a gossip rag!","",""
"63","762","It may have belonged to Plantard.","",""
"63","763","So - he had a taste for sensationalist smut with a right-wing bias?","",""
"63","764","That doesn't tell us much.","",""
"63","765","There's something written in it...","",""
"63","767","Sounds like a betting tip  - the name of a horse and the time of the race.","",""
"63","768","What do you think?","",""
"63","769","That's what I thought, but the name of the meeting isn't given.","",""
"63","770","Well, so what? I'm not in the least bit interested in horse racing, are you?","",""
"63","772","Do you think his next victim will be the jockey, or the horse?","",""
"63","773","She looked at me with a playful twinkle in her eye.","",""
"63","774","Okay - it's a long shot.","",""
"63","775","I don't think it is. That's too obvious.","",""
"63","776","I wouldn't mind betting this is a coded message.","",""
"63","777","It's a romantic notion, but I don't think so...","",""
"63","778","Are you sure you don't want to look at this paper?","",""
"63","779","Positive, thanks.","",""
"63","780","I don't read sensationalist rags like that.","",""
"63","781","Would you like this juggling ball?","",""
"63","782","Have you been drinking, George?","",""
"63","783","No. Why?","",""
"63","784","Because you're talking crap.","",""
"63","785","No, thanks.","",""
"63","786","I found this false nose in the sewer...","",""
"63","787","Hey! What's this inside it?","",""
"63","788","The contents of someone's nose?","",""
"63","789","Don't be gross, George.","",""
"63","790","It says 'La risée du monde - masques et costumes'","",""
"63","791","It has 'La risée du monde' printed inside it...","",""
"63","792","The laughing stock of the world...","",""
"63","793","It's a costume shop near the Gare St Lazare.","",""
"63","794","I know. I've been there.","",""
"63","795","I'll check it out. Maybe the owner remembers who hired the clown costume.","",""
"63","796","Why don't you put it on, George?","",""
"63","797","No way am I wearing this - I'd look really stupid!","",""
"63","798","Besides, he might have had a cold...","",""
"63","799","I showed you the red nose, didn't I?","",""
"63","800","Yes - you did.","",""
"63","801","Why don't you pay a visit to the shop it came from?","",""
"63","802","I already did, but the manager couldn't help me.","",""
"63","803","You shouldn't give up so easily, George.","",""
"63","804","I just might do that...","",""
"63","805","How come you enlarged this photograph of me?","",""
"63","806","Because I noticed the guy behind you, of course.","",""
"63","807","Do you want this photograph back?","",""
"63","808","No, you keep it. I can always make another print.","",""
"63","809","Do you want to look after the gem?","",""
"63","810","No, George. I'd be too tempted to sell it.","",""
"63","811","I found this in the killer's room...","",""
"63","812","What is it? A credit card?","",""
"63","813","I.D. Thomas Moerlin, of the Grüber Electronics Corporation.","",""
"63","814","Never heard of him, or the company.","",""
"63","816","Positive.","",""
"63","817","This is the tool I used to get into the sewers...","",""
"63","818","Fascinating, George.","",""
"63","819","You're not interested, are you?","",""
"63","820","Of course I am. I think it was very brave of you to go down those sewers.","",""
"63","821","Yeah? Well, it was kinda scary, but, well - I had a job to do.","",""
"63","822","Yes, you showed me before.","",""
"63","823","Have you any idea what this tool is intended for?","",""
"63","825","I found this matchbook in the killer's hotel room...","",""
"63","826","It's from the Club Alamut...","",""
"63","827","Never heard of it. Is there anything written inside it?","",""
"63","828","No. What were you expecting?","",""
"63","829","If this was a movie there'd be a clue - a name or an address...","",""
"63","830","That's no use - there aren't even any matches in it.","",""
"63","831","Oh, well. I'll keep it as a souvenir.","",""
"63","832","Did I show you this matchbook?","",""
"63","833","Huh? Oh, yeah.","",""
"63","834","Lobineau says that Alamut is where the Assassins were based...","",""
"63","835","Is that so?","",""
"63","836","Yeah. I wish I knew what the connection was.","",""
"63","837","Can you think of any use for this?","",""
"63","838","That's a thing for measuring blood pressure, isn't it?","",""
"63","839","What are you doing with that?","",""
"63","840","I picked it up in the hospital. Could be useful.","",""
"63","841","You ought to take it back! Don't you feel guilty?","",""
"63","842","Uh... no.","",""
"63","843","Did I show you this?","",""
"63","844","Yes. I still think you ought to return it to the hospital.","",""
"63","845","Do you want to look after this ticket?","",""
"63","846","Not me! I don't want to get involved with a British Railways official!","",""
"63","847","Look - the Inspector gave me his card.","",""
"63","848","Rosso!","",""
"63","849","You know him?","",""
"63","850","Oh, yes. We've met.","",""
"63","851","I didn't know his first name was Augustin! It suits him, I must say.","",""
"63","852","The guy at the novelty shop gave me this...","",""
"63","853","What is it?","",""
"63","854","A hand buzzer. You put it in your hand and give people electric shocks.","",""
"63","855","Why?","",""
"63","856","It's a gag. A practical joke.","",""
"63","857","If you ever use that on me I'll break your arm.","",""
"63","858","Okay, okay! I get the picture...","",""
"63","859","Hey, Nico - shake hands with me!","",""
"63","860","No chance, buster.","",""
"63","861","I found a piece of material near the café...","",""
"63","862","About this material...","",""
"63","864","When I showed it to the concierge, he recognized it right away.","",""
"63","865","It's very distinctive, all right.","",""
"63","866","Just wait until you see this...","",""
"63","867","I developed the film I shot at the café.","",""
"63","868","Here, George - it's an enlargement I made.","",""
"63","869","Look what that guy's wearing.","",""
"63","870","Checkered pants. The same material as I found in the sewer.","",""
"63","871","That's right. This guy shouldn't be difficult to find.","",""
"63","872","Oh, no?","",""
"63","873","Take a close look at his left cheek.","",""
"63","874","A scar in the shape of a horseshoe!","",""
"63","875","...or a crescent moon.","",""
"63","876","I found this tissue down the sewer...","",""
"63","877","Pouah! That's disgusting, George!","",""
"63","878","I think the stuff on it is greasepaint. Like actors use... or clowns.","",""
"63","879","It's still disgusting! Get rid of it!","",""
"63","880","Did I show you this tissue?","",""
"63","881","Yes, George. I asked you to get rid of it.","",""
"63","882","I... uh, brought you a present from Syria.","",""
"63","883","Oh, George - you shouldn't have bothered.","",""
"63","884","What is it?","",""
"63","885","This.","",""
"63","886","A necklace? It's rather heavy...","",""
"63","887","Ethnic craftsmanship at its most rustic.","",""
"63","888","Of course. I love it.","",""
"63","889","You do?","",""
"63","890","It will always remind me of you.","",""
"63","891","This is the chalice I discovered in Spain...","",""
"63","892","I still can't figure why the Countess gave it to you.","",""
"63","893","After losing it for all those years she simply gave it away to a total stranger?","",""
"63","894","She's one prawn short of a paella.","",""
"63","895","The Countess is a fine lady. You shouldn't compare her with seafood.","",""
"63","896","I wouldn't be surprised if there's something going on between you and that Countess...","",""
"63","897","Are you serious? She's old enough to be my grandmother!","",""
"63","898","Did I show you the chalice?","",""
"63","899","Yes, George, you did.","",""
"63","900","Look, Nico - a handful of plaster.","",""
"63","901","Yeah. Why is it that men never really grow up?","",""
"63","902","What's your problem, sister?","",""
"63","903","Your pockets. Stuffed with useless junk, like a little boy's...","",""
"63","904","You never know when useless junk might come in handy.","",""
"63","905","Yeah - you showed me.","",""
"63","906","Look at the chalice now, Nico.","",""
"63","907","What happened? It's shiny!","",""
"63","908","The priest at Montfauçon buffed it up for me.","",""
"63","909","That's incredible!","",""
"63","910","Yeah - it looks as good as new.","",""
"63","911","No - you found a use for a priest. That's incredible.","",""
"63","912","Would you like to look after the chalice?","",""
"63","913","Oh, no. I wouldn't feel comfortable with a sacred relic in the house.","",""
"63","914","Have you any ideas what this lens might be used for?","",""
"63","915","As a magnifying glass, obviously.","",""
"63","916","I'm sure you'll find it very useful...","",""
"63","917","What do you think the purpose of this tripod is?","",""
"63","918","On the manuscript, the gem is shown mounted on top of it.","",""
"63","919","So we risked a criminal charge to steal a display stand?","",""
"63","920","Don't ask me. Maybe it's intended to hold the gem in a specific position.","",""
"63","921","I'm not sure...","",""
"63","922","She ignored me...","",""
"63","923","No, George!","",""
"63","924","What?","",""
"63","925","Leave that torch right where it is.","",""
"63","926","In case you haven't noticed, the crypt is full of gunpowder.","",""
"63","927","So what? Don't you trust me?","",""
"63","928","It's not a question of trust...","",""
"63","929","No? You think I'm a jerk, don't you?","",""
"63","930","Don't be silly, George. And keep your voice down.","",""
"63","931","I thought I heard something... like chanting.","",""
"63","932","Listen! ","",""
"63","933","I can definitely hear chanting. ","",""
"63","934","You're right. I hear it too.","",""
"63","935","What do you suppose they're doing?","",""
"63","936","It wouldn't surprise me if they were holding some kind of satanic sex ritual...","",""
"63","937","So what are we waiting for?","",""
"63","938","Shhhh!","",""
"63","939","I'd feel happier if we had a gun or something.","",""
"63","940","Khan gave me something.","",""
"63","941","What?","",""
"63","942","His handbag. ","",""
"63","943","Great. If we run into any killers, we can give them a good buffeting. ","",""
"63","944","Didn't he have any weapons?","",""
"63","945","You don't know the half of it. This bag's full of C - four!","",""
"63","946","Wow! Why didn't you say so?","",""
"63","947","Boy, we'll show them now!","",""
"63","948","What's C - four?","",""
"63","949","Plastique, George. ","",""
"63","950","We're going to shop our way to victory?","",""
"63","951","Two kilos of plastic explosive. The detonator's broken though.","",""
"63","952","No problem. We'll buy a box of matches somewhere.","",""
"63","953","It doesn't work that way. It takes a small explosion to start the big explosion. ","",""
"63","954","Well that's not much use then.","",""
"63","955","What does that sign say?","",""
"63","956","Apparently, during the English Civil War in the mid-seventeenth century...","",""
"63","957","...this place was used as an arms dump. ","",""
"63","958","Yeah? What happened?","",""
"63","959","Look at the state of this place, George. You work it out.","",""
"63","960","Stray spark?","",""
"63","961","You've got it. The tower was the only thing to survive the blast.","",""
"63","962","I hope the explosion didn't destroy the Sword of Baphomet!","",""
"63","963","Do you? I rather hope it did.","",""
"63","964","What do you think you're doing, George?","",""
"63","965","I wondered if there was a secret mechanism in the demon's mouth.","",""
"63","966","Maybe you should show a little more respect...","",""
"63","967","For a mythical medieval demon? Give me a break!","",""
"63","968","Okay. Go right ahead. Meddle with forces you don't understand.","",""
"63","969","Incur the demon's wrath and burn in hell...","",""
"63","970","Just see if I care...","",""
"63","971","Nico?","",""
"63","972","Uh-huh?","",""
"63","973","It looks like the Templars got here first.","",""
"63","974","We might not be too late. There's still a chance.","",""
"63","975","I wish I had your optimism...","",""
"63","976","So do I, George.","",""
"63","977","Sometimes you're so negative.","",""
"63","978","What are you doing?","",""
"63","979","Committing this inscription to memory...","",""
"63","980","Can you read it?","",""
"63","981","No.","",""
"63","982","What's the point of studying the inscription if you can't read it?","",""
"63","983","Because it could be important - a clue to whatever we're looking for, who knows?","",""
"63","984","I might find someone in Stirling to translate it.","",""
"63","985","We don't have time to go looking for a linguist!","",""
"63","986","No? At least I'm doing something positive.","",""
"63","987","What language is that inscription written in?","",""
"63","988","You're the languages student. You tell me.","",""
"63","989","It's looks like Ancient Norse. Maybe.","",""
"63","990","Perhaps it's in code?","",""
"63","991","I don't think so...","",""
"63","992","Norse code?","",""
"63","993","Any suggestions what I could do with this cog?","",""
"63","994","Well...","",""
"63","995","Look what I found buried in the rubble!","",""
"63","996","It's a plastic pen top...","",""
"63","997","Yeah! Amazing, isn't it - finding something so mundane in a place like this!","",""
"63","998","Astounding. Let me know if you find any paper clips.","",""
"63","999","Look! I found an old coin! You think it's worth anything?","",""
"63","1001","Nico, I found an old clay pipe!","",""
"63","1002","George, I don't care.","",""
"63","1003","The guy at the novelty shop gave me this...","",""

"63","1011","No chance, buster.","",""
"63","1012","What should I do with this ticket?","",""
"63","1013","Throw it away next time we pass a waste bin.","",""
"63","1014","I thought I'd keep it as a souvenir...","",""
"63","1015","That's the face of the statue I saw at the Bull's Head...","",""
"63","1016","Excuse me, madamoiselle!","",""
"63","1020","He probably plans to use the pixie suit next time he kills.","",""
"63","1021","The poor guy sounded scared out of his wits.","",""
"63","1022","Eh bien... and what have you been up to?","",""
"63","1023","Say - you could interview me. About the bombing...!","",""
"63","1024","I know it sounds crazy, but he was dressed like a clown!","",""
"63","1025","Maybe he can't take the pressure that goes with the job.","",""
"63","1026","And with his unshaven chin all scratchy in my ear, he told me his secret...","",""
"63","1027","I'll tell you what - I won't be accepting any invitations to costume parties.","",""
"63","1028","Let's take a closer look at the manuscript...","",""
"63","1029","Do you mind if Lobineau sees the manuscript?","",""
"63","1030","Lobineau explained who the Hashshashin were.","",""
"63","1031","Call me George... and it was my pleasure.","",""
"63","1032","Are you sure you've never heard of Thomas Moerlin?","",""
"63","1033","I saw a bunch of guys masquerading as Templars!","",""
"63","1034","Listen - we have to hurry. Let's go, George...","",""
"63","1035","She was the one who said: `Mirror, mirror, on the wall,' wasn't she?","",""
"63","1040","The guy responsible for their downfall was Philip the fourth, the King of France.","",""
"63","1041","No, but it could be a clue to the killer's next move.","",""
"63","1044","`Salah-eh Dinn, thirteen forty-five.'","",""
"63","1045","That was some feat - abseiling through the skylight, I mean.","",""
"63","1046","It's all part of the same thing. The chalice is important, I'm sure.","",""
"63","1047","It was YOU who stole the tripod.","",""
"63","1048","Hey, Nico.","",""
"63","1049","I'll let you work it out...","",""

"63","1056","Not unless you have Rosso's gift for psychic interrogation.","",""
"63","1057","How did Plantard get your name?","",""
"63","1058","Through the newspaper - La Liberté.","",""
"63","1059","I'd written an article linking two unsolved murders, one in Italy, the other in Japan.","",""

"64","17","Keep it to yourself, Benoir.","",""
"64","18","Yes, sir?","",""
"64","19","There's no need to shout.","",""
"64","20","What do you want?","",""
"64","21","Use it on Nurse Grendel.","",""
"64","22","Huh?","",""
"64","23","Go on - she'll enjoy it.","",""
"64","24","Well, okay...","",""
"64","25","Docteur Stobbart!","",""
"64","26","Yeah?","",""
"64","27","I would appreciate it if you saved your jokes for the interns' rest room.","",""
"64","28","This is a hospital ward, not a cabaret.","",""
"64","29","Aw, lighten up!","",""
"64","30","I heard that! Any more nonsense and I shall report you to Doctor Hagenmeyer!","",""
"64","31","Use it on Eric Sopmarsh.","",""
"64","32","Okay...","",""
"64","33","Use it on Renée Croquet.","",""
"64","34","Okay...","",""
"64","35","Are you ready with that pressure gauge?","",""

"64","45","Shut up, Benoir.","",""
"64","46","Okay, sir.","",""

"64","54","Oh, no, sir. Definitely not, sir. Most emphatically not, sir.","",""
"64","55","I thought so.","",""
"64","56","Underneath that starched waiter's uniform you're nothing but a worm.","",""

"66","37","Yes, it does. I feel I kinda... owe it to him, to find his killer.","",""
"66","38","That is best left to the authorities, m'sieur.","",""
"66","39","Did he speak to you, tell you anything?","",""
"66","40","No. He just grinned and nodded.","",""
"66","41","Don't let it trouble you, m'sieur. Go home and try to forget.","",""

"66","44","No - but...","",""
"66","45","We'll know everything there is to know about him, soon enough.","",""
"66","46","I'm trying to be helpful here!","",""
"66","47","The best way you can help us is to go home, m'sieur.","",""
"66","48","I have a confession to make, Sergeant.","",""
"66","49","I really did see the clown.","",""
"66","50","He ran into the alley across the street.","",""
"66","51","Why did you not tell this to Inspecteur Rosso?","",""
"66","52","I didn't want to sound foolish...","",""
"66","53","And you did not want to become involved, no?","",""
"66","54","Do not worry. It is of no consequence.","",""
"66","55","I will inform m'sieur l'Inspecteur when he has finished with the girl.","",""
"66","56","Did you follow him?","",""
"66","57","I lost him. I figure he went under ground.","",""

"66","60","I have no doubt that Inspecteur Rosso will organize a proper search.","",""
"66","61","That's your job, not mine.","",""
"66","62","An armed chase through the streets of Paris?","",""
"66","63","That's not our style, m'sieur.","",""
"66","64","Inspecteur Rosso may be unorthodox, but he's not crazy!","",""
"66","65","I've tracked down the clown's movements, sergeant!","",""
"66","66","Is that so, m'sieur?","",""
"66","67","Yeah. There's a man down the street who saw him crawling out of the sewer!","",""
"66","68","Dressed as a clown?","",""
"66","69","No - he'd changed into ordinary clothes by then.","",""
"66","70","So how did he know it was the clown?","",""
"66","71","He didn't, but all the clues add up.","",""
"66","72","Little children can add up, but I wouldn't let them manage my bank account...","",""
"66","73","Did you find the victim's briefcase yet?","",""
"66","74","No, sir. The Inspector gave me specific instructions to guard this door.","",""
"66","75","Until he countermands those orders, or back-up arrives, here I stay.","",""
"66","76","Is Rosso here?","",""
"66","77","Yes, he is. You wish to speak to him?","",""
"66","78","Yes, I do.","",""
"66","79","One moment, m'sieur.","",""

"66","95","And what do you think?","",""
"66","96","I think he is the Devil.","",""
"66","97","What is Rosso doing with that girl?","",""
"66","98","He is `giving her the once over' as you Americans say.","",""
"66","100","Once he gets his teeth into a case, nothing will shake him off.","",""
"66","101","Was he serious about all that `psycho-detective' stuff?","",""
"66","102","Of course! Inspecteur Rosso is a pioneer and a visionary.","",""
"66","103","His revolutionary methods, once perfected, may change the face of law enforcement forever!","",""
"66","104","I can't see it taking off in LA.","",""
"66","105","Do you know a man named Khan?","",""
"66","106","He's a shifty looking guy with a scar on his left cheek.","",""

"66","141","The Hagenmeyer Clinic, in the Avenue des Hérissons.","",""
"66","142","Why was Marquet known as the Mole of Montmartre?","",""

"66","144","Yes, but why the Mole?","",""
"66","145","I don't know. Maybe he ruined people's lawns.","",""
"66","146","See you later, sergeant.","",""

"66","148","It is a ball. The ball of a child.","",""

"66","191","Don't try my patience, m'sieur.","",""
"66","192","Look, sergeant - the Inspector gave me his card...","",""
"66","193","Yes, m'sieur.","",""
"66","194","He wants you to advise him if you have any information concerning this case.","",""
"66","195","I'd be glad to talk with him, but I don't want him working his psycho weirdness on me.","",""
"66","196","Ah, no, m'sieur. You are confusing the science of parapsychology with witchcraft.","",""
"66","197","Oh, yeah? What's the difference?","",""
"66","198","We don't do sacrifices.","",""
"66","199","I've got Inspector Rosso's address card...","",""
"66","200","Yes, m'sieur. You showed me before...","",""
"66","201","Does the name 'Moerlin' mean anything to you, Sergeant?","",""
"66","202","Nothing, m'sieur.","",""
"66","203","It's one of the names the killer is using.","",""
"66","204","Ah - you refer to the clown, of course.","",""
"66","205","Right.","",""
"66","206","What do you suppose this tool is used for, Sergeant Moue?","",""
"66","207","It looks like something an obstetrician would use, m'sieur...","",""
"66","208","It was with tools like this that the clown made his escape!","",""
"66","209","I don't understand...","",""
"66","210","He opened up the hole and disappeared into the bowels of the earth!","",""
"66","211","If you say so, m'sieur.","",""
"66","212","I don't think so. I found it in that workman's toolbox.","",""
"66","213","Found it? I hope you did not steal it, m'sieur!","",""
"66","214","Do I look like a common thief?","",""
"66","215","He asked me to look after his hole, and his belongings.","",""
"66","216","You certainly know how to enjoy your vacation to the fullest, m'sieur.","",""
"66","217","Did I show you my tool, Sergeant?","",""
"66","218","Yes, m'sieur - unfortunately you did.","",""
"66","219","Does this matchbook mean anything to you, Sergeant?","",""
"66","220","That's a double-lined Swedish with a cross-hatch Bergmann strike-strip.","",""
"66","221","Now, that's unusual. Pre-war Anderson hinging!","",""
"66","222","Really?","",""
"66","223","I haven't seen a reinforced Anderson outside of a private collection!","",""
"66","224","It's rare, then?","",""

"66","226","There are only three places these are made: Tai-Wan, Manilla, and Slough.","",""
"66","227","You already showed me, m'sieur. It's a beauty.","",""
"66","228","I believe this material came from the clown's clothing.","",""
"66","229","If you are right, m'sieur, then the clown must be an Englishman.","",""
"66","230","How do you figure that?","",""
"66","231","Only the English would wear a suit made from material like that.","",""
"66","232","Don't you like the English?","",""
"66","233","It is not so much a question of liking, rather one of taste.","",""
"66","234","They have none. ","",""
"66","235","Did I show you this material, Sergeant?","",""
"66","236","Yes, m'sieur. It is horrible.","",""
"66","237","Do you recognize this dirty tissue?","",""
"66","238","No, m'sieur, I do not.","",""
"66","239","I found it in the sewer...","",""
"66","241","No way! This could be an important clue.","",""
"66","242","If you say so, m'sieur.","",""
"66","243","I told you - no, m'sieur.","",""
"66","244","What do you think of this chalice, Sergeant?","",""
"66","245","Hmm. Not much.","",""
"66","246","It's over six hundred years old!","",""
"66","247","It looks it. I wouldn't drink from that rusty old thing if I was you.","",""
"66","248","Would you like to shake my hand, Sergeant?","",""
"66","249","Not while I'm on duty, m'sieur. The gesture could be misconstrued.","",""
"66","250","What?","",""
"66","251","I'm the victim! I've been harassed by a pair of thugs.","",""
"66","252","Perhaps it would be better if you put it back there...","",""
"66","253","The most cunning circus performer turned pick pocket in Paris.","",""
"67","1","Hi there!","",""

"67","3","I knew you'd come back, and now I've got you!","",""
"67","4","What are you talking about?","",""
"67","5","You're trespassing! Come out of there immediately!","",""
"67","6","That's what I'm trying to do...","",""
"67","7","Give me your hand!","",""
"67","8","You won't catch me with tricks like that!","",""
"67","9","Keep your distance, m'sieur!","",""
"67","10","Okay, okay!","",""
"67","11","Now, what were you looking for?","",""
"67","12","Terrorists.","",""
"67","13","The meanest, nastiest, dirtiest bunch of guys you ever saw!","",""
"67","14","Ah...! Englishmen, without a doubt. The filthy dogs!","",""
"67","15","The day they opened that tunnel was a bad day for France, I'll tell you.","",""
"67","16","If I still had the full use of my faculties, I'd march right over there and tell them so!","",""
"67","17","Well, whoever they are, they blew up the café.","",""
"67","18","I was looking for a clown.","",""
"67","19","Ridiculous! Do you really expect me to believe that?","",""
"67","20","He planted a bomb in the café and blew it up.","",""
"67","21","A telephone. I need to make an urgent call.","",""
"67","23","I want to know what you were doing in the sewer.","",""
"67","24","Didn't you hear the explosion?","",""
"67","25","In the sewer? A deadly cocktail of combustible gases and chemicals, most likely.","",""
"67","26","No - at the café. A deadly cocktail of accordion music and villainy, most definitely.","",""
"67","27","What!? The café? Blown up!?","",""
"67","28","Mon dieu! That's awful.","",""
"67","29","The guy who did it was a calculating, cold-blooded killer.","",""
"67","30","He was disguised as a clown.","",""
"67","31","I followed him into the sewer, and I think he came this way...","",""
"67","32","And you say the person responsible was dressed as a clown?","",""
"67","33","That's right. He blew up the café, escaped into the sewer, changed his clothes, and came up here!","",""
"67","34","Did you say `accordion music'?","",""
"67","35","Yeah. That fiend had no mercy.","",""
"67","36","He was disguised as a clown.","",""
"67","37","By the time the bomb went off he'd run to the sewer and made his escape.","",""
"67","38","Mon dieu!","",""
"67","39","Then the man I chased - do you think that man and the clown are...","",""
"67","40","...one and the same?","",""
"67","41","Well, yes - it had crossed my mind.","",""
"67","42","That still doesn't explain what you were doing down the sewer...","",""
"67","43","For all I know you are in league with him!","",""
"67","44","Oh, no. I'm just a tourist.","",""
"67","45","Most tourists are content with the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre or the Pigalle...","",""
"67","46","I didn't realize my waste pipes were such an attraction!","",""
"67","47","Hi there. Remember me?","",""
"67","48","Mais oui, Inspecteur. Have you found him?","",""
"67","49","Who?","",""
"67","50","The man in the sewer of course!","",""
"67","51","I'm - uh... sifting through the evidence.","",""
"67","52","Pouah! Rather you than me, m'sieur!","",""
"67","53","That reminds me, someone's been impersonating you!","",""
"67","56","I didn't tell him I'd been talking to you not hours before!","",""
"67","57","Thank goodness! Uh... impersonating a police officer is a serious offense.","",""
"67","58","A man with so little respect for the law must be desperate!","",""
"67","59","As my father used to say: `Desperation opens the door to the devil!'","",""
"67","60","He was always coming out with things like that.","",""
"67","61","Stupid man...","",""
"67","62","So, when you're not exploring sewers, what do you do?","",""
"67","63","I take a lot of showers.","",""
"67","64","Oh, very good, m'sieur. A policeman with a sense of humor!","",""
"67","65","How could I forget? The man with the sewer obsession...","",""
"67","67","Hello again.","",""
"67","68","Yes, Inspecteur?","",""
"67","69","Yes, Inspecteur?","",""
"67","70","What now?","",""
"67","71","So you don't want to hear about my experiences in the desert?","",""
"67","72","I fought to make this country what it is today!","",""
"67","73","I'm sure you did, but I'm a little short of time.","",""
"67","74","Was the guy you saw carrying a briefcase?","",""
"67","75","Why, yes - he was! Clutched in his arms like a baby.","",""
"67","76","That belonged to his victim.","",""
"67","77","What do you think was in it? Drugs? Stolen jewels?","",""
"67","79","Nothing is worth that, m'sieur.","",""
"67","80","I didn't notice.","",""
"67","81","Now, are you going to leave, or do I have to call the police?","",""
"67","82","Do you know the waitress at the café?","",""
"67","83","You can't suspect her, surely?","",""
"67","84","Just answer the question, please.","",""
"67","85","Yes - I know her. Quite well, you could say.","",""
"67","86","She came to work at the Café, oh... six, seven months ago.","",""
"67","88","I look forward all week to the relief she gives me when she visits.","",""
"67","89","Really? So you'd miss her if she wasn't there?","",""

"67","102","The man who was killed in the café.","",""
"67","103","I'm going to find the guy responsible.","",""
"67","105","Bravo!","",""
"67","106","You'll need some sensible boots.","",""
"67","107","You won't get far in those stupid sneakers.","",""
"67","108","Now - about the jacket you found... Do you have it here?","",""
"67","109","No, m'sieur. One of the sleeves was badly torn, so I sent it for repair.","",""
"67","110","A pity, because otherwise it was a fine piece of quality tailoring.","",""
"67","111","It had the tailor's name inside, on the label.","",""
"67","112","Where did you send the jacket?","",""
"67","113","I gave it to an itinerant Romany seamstress.","",""
"67","114","Just my luck.","",""

"67","118","Not a sou!","",""
"67","119","You know what I think?","",""
"67","120","Do tell me...","",""
"67","121","He changed out of the clown suit and cunningly disguised himself as an ordinary person!","",""
"67","122","Looks like I'm up against a mastermind...","",""
"67","123","What was the name on the label?","",""
"67","124","It was a foreign name... Todryk, I think.","",""
"67","125","Did you get the address?","",""
"67","126","There wasn't one, m'sieur: only a telephone number.","",""
"67","129","Seventy-four, ninety-eight, zero, eight, fifty-nine.","",""
"67","130","You're kidding. That's his phone number?","",""
"67","131","Yes, that's it. A little trick with numbers that I learned in the desert.","",""
"67","132","I was taught the technique by a Tuareg shamen.","",""
"67","133","That's incredible!","",""
"67","134","It comes in handy at the supermarket check out...","",""
"67","135","Do I get a reward?","",""

"67","138","Tell me about the man you apprehended...","",""
"67","139","Oh, he was a mean one, m'sieur.","",""
"67","142","He grabbed me in an arm lock, his face suddenly next to mine.","",""
"67","143","His grip was like iron, but he didn't know what he was up against...!","",""
"67","144","Oh, no. He made a big mistake when he took on one of the Desert Hyenas!","",""
"67","145","Yes, yes. I get the picture.","",""
"67","146","What is there to tell? He was a typical criminal type, just like you!","",""
"67","147","I have to be going...","",""

"67","150","Good luck, Inspecteur! I hope you catch that killer soon!","",""
"67","152","Take a look at this false nose...","",""
"67","153","That looks like a clown's nose to me!","",""
"67","154","Precisely. He must have dropped it in his panic.","",""
"67","155","Unless he wanted you to find it...","",""
"67","156","Why would he want to do that?","",""
"67","157","To put you off the scent!","",""
