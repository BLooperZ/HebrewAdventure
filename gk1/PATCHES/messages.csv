Dearest Father:  I offer these final words as apology for the failure I have made of my life and the harm I have done our sacred family office.  Last night I learned that the women I wrote of, Tetelo, was the witch I sought.  I committed terrible crimes, Father.  First, I loved this witch.  Second, I betrayed her.  Third, I used our sacred family power to free her and aid her in destroying this colony.  The talisman is gone--Tetelo took it.  I can but pray for thy eventual forgiveness, for thy swift recovery of the talisman, and that my punishment in Hell will be long and bitter.
Thy undeserving son--Gunter",,
