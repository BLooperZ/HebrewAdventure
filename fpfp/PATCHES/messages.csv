Coarsegold came to a nasty end, whut with the... well, I don't like t' talk about it, it gimmee the ol' white trash blues.",,
99,3,0,6,1,57,"Poor ol' Freddy Pharkas done laughed hisself to death... but the folks of Coarsegold, they wuzn't laughin' two weeks later when the whole town got bought up from underneath 'em. Ol' Willy's done spinnin' yarns fer now. This one always makes me go all teary-eyed and phlegmy.",,
99,3,0,7,1,57,"Well, you gots to admit the fella died tryin' to defend his town. Now, we all either hadda leave town or get shot up anyways, so it's not as if Freddy'd done any real good, but it were still excitin' to have him around fer awhile. I guess that story don't end so good. Lemme see, have I told you th' one about the travelin' band uniform salesman and the librarian? Welp, it seems there was trouble in River City, and they had this pool table, and...",,
99,3,0,8,1,57,"So thet's how Freddy's brilliant career done come to a screechin' halt. He sank into the swamp and wuz never seen again. A shame, too, 'cuz the rest of us were kinda plannin' on bein' in the sequel. That ain't one of my better stories, anyhoo.  Say, did I ever tell ya the story about ol' King Graham? It seems there wuz this evil wizard, and he got Graham into just a peck o' trouble...",,
99,3,0,9,1,57,"Kinda silly, but yep, that's how Freddy died... crushed by a load of bicarbonate while tryin' to put out the fire at the ol' Assay office. The whole town burned to the ground that night, and the British troops got turned back. British Troops?  Waitaminnit, I'm getting confused. OH, okay, now I remembers. It wuzn't Freddy that got squashed by them sacks of powder, that wuz sumthin' else. Lemme go back and figger out what actually DID happen to Freddy Pharkas.",,
99,3,0,10,1,57,"Yep, Freddy fell down, went ""boom."" It were a sad day, we found 'em all squished and not really livin' anymore. 'Course, we had our own problems to deal with, all of a sudden-like. Thet's about when the town of Coarsegold ceased to exist, as we'd done known it. But thet's another story, boys 'n girls. I gots to be alone wif my thoughts fer awhile.",,
99,3,0,11,1,57,"Nope, Freddy didn't quite make it outta that schoolhouse alive. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. Nunh-unh. Penelope, she bought up the whole town, or whut wuz left of it after the explosion, and made a fortune with the oil rights. How wuz we to know the town wuz built on oil fields? We didn't even know whut oil wuz! We warn't STUPID, y'know. Just nobody'd told us whut OIL were! Fer corn's sake! Now I'm riled.  Go tell yerself stories fum now on. Don't even talk to me.",,
99,3,0,12,1,57,"Guess ol' Freddy just warn't thinkin' too well thet day. Them guns hadn't been fired in decades. The resultin' explosion took off Freddy's hands, his forearms, shattered his clavicle and broke his whutcha call your left tibia. He died kinda messy-like a couple hours later. As fer the rest of Coarsegold, well... let's just say it wuz laid to rest not long afterwards.",,
99,3,0,13,1,57,"Yip, Freddy's itchy trigger finger got th' best of him. The sheriff wuzn't about to let Freddy git away with shootin' folks in cold blood. 'Course, the Sheriff pretty much shut down the town a few days later, throwin' everybuddy out inta the street. Never did figger out who he was actin' on behalf of, anyways. And thet's m'story fer now, boys and girls. Mah ol' epiglottis ain't whut she used ta be.",,
99,3,0,14,1,57,"So Freddy were left fer dead, oozin' blood inta the hard-packed dirt of the streets of Coarsegold. Not long afterwards, those who wouldn't git outta their beloved Coarsegold ended up the same way. Life's a real bitch sumtimes, ain't she? Pardon me now, nature's callin'.",,
99,3,0,15,1,57,"Yip, Freddy met his death at the tip of a sword. Too bad, 'cuz he'd gotten so close to savin' Coarsegold from fallin' into Penelope's mercenary clutches. So Penelope went ahead with her little scheme.  She bought up the town real cheap and made millions in the oil industry. She died just a few years back, but she wuz so rich that she had herself froze solid 'til they could find a way to bring her back to life. Ain't that a hoot?",,
99,3,0,16,1,57,"...Mebbe if Freddy'd found sum way to stop ""Aces"" before he'd won up all the deeds to the town, there'd still be a Coarsegold today. 'Course, Aces weren't actin' on his own, sumbuddy'd put him up to it.  Never found out who or why, though. And as fer me, I got outta town by sundown and hightailed it to the Ozarks, where a man kin still be a man wifout other men questionin' me about bein' manly or not. But that ain't neither here nor there. Now get outta here.",,
99,3,0,17,1,57,"Now it wuzn't as if Freddy didn't have enuf time to stop them snails, but somehow, he screwed it up but good. The snails ran over Coarsegold and slimed it to kingdom come. Those of us thet wuzn't kilt hadda leave town without bringin' anything with us. I wuz one of the ones that didn't make it. Thet's right, sonny! Yer talkin' to a GHOST! BOO!!! Nyah-ha-ha... <cough> <wheeze> <hack>",,
99,3,0,18,1,57,"So 'cuz Freddy couldn't think of a way to put out the fire, all of Coarsegold was in ashes by the next mornin'. The loss of life wuz tree-menjus, but somewhere, sumbuddy was sure happy about it, 'cuz before you knew it... Well, thet's another story, boys 'n girls.",,
99,3,0,19,1,57,"...and them rowdy cowhands, whom sumbody'd hired to come in and skare folks off a bit, ended up shootin' Freddy and chasin' everbody outta town. And as fer Coarsegold, well, none of us ever found out who wuz behind all the evildoin's. Not that we cared. It warn't that much of a town, anyways. Say, did I ever tell ya the story about a little nose-pickin' brat named Willy Beamish? Welp, it all started in this town that wuz mostly strip-malls...",,
99,3,0,20,1,57,"That's how it all ended. Freddy'd let the whole dang town die o' the creepin' cruds. I wuz lucky, I stuck to whisky so's I wouldn't get poizoned by the town's drinkin' water. Iffn only Freddy'd used his pharmacological powers fer the good o' the town. <sigh> Then this story'd mighta had a happier endin'.",,
99,3,0,21,1,57,"So after awhile, most folks in town plum passed out from the noxious fumes. Them that didn't get kilt by the aroma got kilt when sum idjit struck a flint. Anyways, it was a painless way t' go, even if it were kinda nauseating. And Freddy, well, at least he didn't have to reckon with his secret past anymore. Now if Freddy had just thunk a little bit faster an' a little bit smarter, things mighta turned out a mite different. Now, how 'bout another story, or did you wanna hear this one again?",,
99,3,0,22,1,57,"So before he hardly got nowhere, Freddy sold out to the Banker and walked outta Coarsegold with enough cash to start a new life somewheres else. Naah, we don't keep in touch no more. I kinda resent the guy, him sellin' us all down the river and sich. We all hadda give up our propitty after that. For all I know, he died in a pharmacy, and good riddance to him. He wuz never nuttin' special, anyway. I forgit why I even brought him up.",,

600,37,2,26,3,49,How do you propose I should deal with them?,,
600,37,2,26,4,40,I find humor a way to defuse hot tempers. But I am a humble pharmacist's assistant. Perhaps I am looking at the situation from too far away.,,

660,11,2,16,2,53,I'm not talking to you right now. I'm ashamed to be your Mom. Now you just turn right around and go outside and THINK about what you've done for awhile. You can come back in here when you decide to behave like a human being again.,,

660,11,2,15,4,53,So THAT'S the stench I've been smelling! What an inconsiderate clod you can be. That burnt baking-soda smell is simply nauseating. It's no wonder I've got no customers today.,,

660,11,2,9,2,53,"Not that it's any of your business, but I'll be keeping my customers in here as long as I can. 'Course, if they just keep ordering weak tea and Uwanna Biscuits, I'll toss their butts into the street. Can't make any money selling tea and frickin' biscuits!",,

660,11,2,10,4,53,"I don't know anything about no stampede. Unless they're stopping here to eat, I don't even care. As for salt, you KNOW we're a salt-free community! That's why everyone's so laid back. Low blood pressure. And we aim to keep it that way.",,
660,11,2,10,5,49,"Dang! Well, what could I use?",,
660,11,2,10,6,53,Beer works for me. I just spread a little of it out along the back porch and the little buggers just follow it right off!,,

730,8,1,0,1,99,It's a little brown jug.,,
730,8,4,0,1,99,"Oh, sure, let's pour a little moonshine on the burning oil and see if |c0|that|c| helps. Anyway, you can't reach it from here.",,
730,9,1,0,1,99,This decorative toy chest is old and worthless.,,
730,9,4,0,1,99,"Yes, crawling through the puddle of oil to get to the toy chest seems like a smashingly good idea, doesn't it? Think again, Brainiac!",,
730,10,1,0,1,99,An old barrel of some sort stands far out of reach in the corner of the room.,,
730,10,4,0,1,99,Try looking at it and reading the words very carefully.,,

730,16,4,0,1,99,"Hey, that's school property, leave it alone.",,
730,17,1,0,1,99,It's the dank little schoolhouse basement. The walls and columns are made of rough brick; the stone floor is dirty and uneven.,,

730,25,4,0,1,99,Those charts will do you no good whatsoever. They're years out of date!,,
730,26,1,0,1,99,"Looks like the oily swamp water has seeped into the basement. Wait! That's not swamp water. That must be |c0|oil|c|!! It's what Penelope was after all along... Coarsegold was sitting on a rich oil deposit, and you never even realized it!",,
730,26,4,0,1,99,"Maybe you should be finding a way to avoid the oil as much as possible, rather than trying to splash about in it.",,
730,27,1,0,1,99,It's your silver ear. Your cover's blown now!,,
730,27,4,1,1,99,"You can't reach it from the chair, Freddy!",,
730,27,4,2,1,99,"You ""scooch"" the chair closer and closer to your precious silver ear... and just manage to snag it!",,
730,28,1,0,1,99,"The basement floor is bare rock. Well, it WOULD be bare if it weren't so dirty.",,
730,28,4,0,1,99,The ground feels like solid rock with a layer of dust on top.,,
730,28,55,0,1,99,Smart thinking! You frantically give the silver ear a few quick rubs on the stone floor.,,
730,29,60,0,1,99,You manage to slice into the ropes with the sharpened silver ear!,,
740,12,1,0,1,99,"Him again! It's Kenny the Kid, your arch-nemesis from your gunslinging days. He stares at you murderously, with glassy eyes and icewater in his veins. Or maybe he's got icewater in his eyes and glass in his veins? No, wait! He's got veins in his eyes and icewater in a glass! That's it!",,
740,12,2,0,1,49,"Kenny, we're not kids anymore. We're grown up. We're both adults. Let's settle this reasonably.",,
740,12,2,0,2,54,I don't wanna. You can't make me. You're not the boss of me!,,
740,12,2,0,3,49,I take back what I said about us both being adults.,,
740,12,2,0,4,54,"Oh, yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue. Everything you say bounces off me and sticks to you!",,
740,12,4,0,1,99,"If you touch Kenny, you'll have to turn your back on Penelope, and she'll stab you through the heart. Then again, if you ignore Kenny, he'll surely put a bullet through your heart. This situation basically sucks.",,
740,12,61,0,1,99,"Unfortunately, you're using the sword to keep Penelope at bay. You'll have to find some other way to deal with Kenny!",,
740,14,1,0,1,99,"You see Penelope in a whole new light, now that you know what a cad and a bounder she is! That angelic face belies the vicious, calculating, cold-hearted murderer she really is! But, hoo boy, you still wouldn't mind those lips touching yours, and... NO!  Stop thinking that way! She's a bad girl! BAD girl!",,
740,14,2,0,1,49,"Penelope, can't we talk this out like civilized people?",,
740,14,2,0,2,56,Talk all you like. I'm fencing.,,
740,14,2,0,3,49,"Oh, my gosh! First you plot to destroy Coarsegold, then you sell stolen property? The shame of it all!",,
740,14,2,0,4,56,"Not THAT kind of fencing, you fool! SWORD fencing!",,
740,14,2,0,5,49,"Oh, okay! Now I got it!",,
740,14,4,0,1,99,There's no way you'll be able to grab her before she turns you into Fred-Ka-Bobs!,,
740,14,60,0,1,99,"There's a better deadly weapon for dealing with her! Actually, there's TWO, but this game is rated PG!",,
740,18,0,0,1,49,"Justice will be done, madam!",,
740,18,0,0,2,56,Damn! I knew I shouldn't have wasted my time packing those student folders! I shall allow you to choose the manner of your demise.,,
740,18,0,0,3,49,Say what?,,
740,18,0,0,4,56,"Sorry, you took too long to decide.",,
740,18,0,0,5,99,Penelope grabs one of the swords off the Civil War display above the blackboard.,,
740,18,0,2,1,56,Curses! You've foiled me!,,
740,18,0,2,2,49,"It's not a foil, it's a sabre. A foil is straight and has two sharp edges, unless it's the smaller French foil which is dull and is used chiefly for thrusting. A sabre, like this one, is curved and has one sharp edge. As a teacher and a member of the fencing team, you of all people should have known THAT!",,
740,18,0,2,3,56,"Oh, no... foiled, defeated AND corrected! Now I REALLY feel bad.",,
740,18,0,2,4,49,"And thank god for my high school intramural sports program! Otherwise, I'd be fettucine al Freddy by now!",,
740,18,0,6,1,56,Did I forget to mention downstairs that Meadville Normal had the nation's first female fencing team?,,
740,19,0,0,1,54,"Why, it's you! I recognize you now! From the old neighborhood. Freddy something!",,
740,19,0,0,2,49,"Good to see you again, Kenny. I hope I didn't hurt your hand out there in the street.",,
740,19,0,0,3,54,"Whoa! That was you, out there? I didn't recognize you. Have you done something with your hair?",,
740,19,0,3,1,54,"It's funny, Pharkas! I thought I killed your sorry ass back in St. Louis!",,
740,19,0,4,1,49,"No, not my hair, Kenny, but THIS!",,
740,19,0,4,2,99,"Hurling your sharpened ear like a Chinese throwing star, you whip it at Kenny, catching him right in the throat!",,

740,33,4,0,1,99,No need to take the broom. It's not like you have to bring it back to the Wizard as proof that you defeated Penelope.,,
740,34,1,0,1,99,"It's a rickety wooden bucket, long past usefulness and into the ""quaint decor"" mode.",,
740,34,4,0,1,99,The old wooden bucket isn't sturdy enough to be of any use.,,
740,35,1,0,1,99,The left window is closed.,,

740,36,1,0,1,99,A row of pegs for coats is hung on the wall here. Looks like one of the children forgot to take his or her coat. There's gonna be hell to pay at home later!,,
740,36,4,0,1,99,"You rifle through the child's coat pockets, looking for loot, but you find nothing. You crumb.",,
740,37,1,0,1,99,"You see row upon row of quaint school desks, complete with one-piece bench, desktop and inkwell. Eww, one of 'em still has some poor girl's pigtail stuck in it!",,

740,38,1,0,1,99,The latest and greatest American flag stands at limp attention. A feeling not wholly unfamiliar to you!,,
740,38,4,0,1,99,This would be a terrible time to wrap yourself in the flag! It has a very low armor factor!,,
740,39,1,0,1,99,"It's a ball of some sort, with strange markings all over it. At first, you think it's supposed to be the Earth, but the Earth is very slightly egg-shaped, so that obviously isn't it. Anyway, you scarcely have time to worry about it right now.",,
740,39,4,0,1,99,You can't reach the strange orb!,,
740,40,1,0,1,99,How nice! Some of the children's artwork has been placed up on the wall for all to admire.,,
740,40,1,0,2,49,"Say, if only somebody would invent a box with an electric heat exchange unit and some sort of gaseous coolant, you could use magnets to affix these pictures to the outside of the box and display them thusly in a kitchen!",,
740,40,1,0,3,99,But that's not important right now.,,
740,40,4,0,1,99,You resolve to return at a calmer moment and retrieve some of these pictures to decorate your Pharmacy. The fire burning downstairs notwithstanding.,,

740,41,4,0,1,99,There's more than enough light for you to see what you need to do.,,
740,42,1,0,1,99,This window's propped open.,,
740,42,4,0,1,99,"Your life is in jeopardy. Don't make things worse by making the room stuffier. And no, you can't escape by leaping from the window! Penelope would run you through the moment you turned your back!",,
740,43,1,0,1,99,Some old camel's hair paintbrushes sit on the shelf. Just in case the kids decide they want to paint some camel hair!,,
740,43,4,0,1,99,This is no time for arts 'n crafts!,,
740,44,1,0,1,99,This is the one-room schoolhouse. It's a lot dingier and darker on the inside than it looked from the outside... just like Penelope!,,
740,44,2,0,1,99,Now's not the time for idle chit-chat with the scenery! It's time for ACTION!,,
740,44,4,0,1,99,"That won't help you |c0|now|c|, Freddy!",,
740,45,1,0,1,99,"There's a small map of the United States. Have you noticed how California, on the map to the right, appears to be larger than all of the United States put together? That's California ego for you!",,
740,45,4,0,1,99,"Perfect! You grab the map, roll it up, and konk Penelope over the head with it. Not!",,
740,46,1,0,1,99,There on the wall are a couple of small daguerreotypes. Looks like the kids too some crayons to 'em.,,
740,46,4,0,1,99,Those li'l pictures are too flimsy to be of any use to you.,,
740,47,1,0,1,99,"This stove keeps the kiddies warm in the winter, and dries their mukluks.",,
740,47,4,0,1,99,The stove is cold and empty. How like Penelope's heart!,,
740,48,1,0,1,99,Looks like somebody started a very nice portrait of George Washington... The Father of Plywood Dentures.,,
740,48,4,0,1,99,Now's no time to be taking pictures!,,
740,49,1,0,1,99,Some old chunks of hardwood sit in the scuttle.,,
