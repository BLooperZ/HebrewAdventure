002,5,This is the escape pod which safely whisked you away from Vohaul's burning asteroid fortress. The skin of the pod plainly registers the cumulative damage long periods of space travel can inflict on a small craft such as this.,זוהי חללית החילוץ שמילטה אותך ממוות בטוח במבצר האסטרואידים הבוער בוואהל. הנזקים המצטברים מנסיעות החלל הממושכות הותירו את רישומם על גבי מעטפת החללית.,"צריך אחידות בתרגום של Vohaul.

תיקנתי, אך השארתי שינוי אחד משם, שם כתוב מבצר חלל וכאן מבצר אסטרואידים.
צ: למה? בכוונה? לא עדיף שיהיה אותו הדבר?
לא באמת משנה לי, סתם סקרן...
ע. משום שאם תשים לב כאן כתוב asteroid fortress ושם כתוב space fortress.
צ. אה, סבבה. אכן לא שמתי לב."
002,6,You are standing in a debris-cluttered junk bay. An escape pod rests in the middle of the room. There are chunks of metal lying around which seem to be small sections of old spaceware.,אתה עומד על מסוף גרוטאות עמוס פסולת. חללית החילוץ נחה במרכז החדר. פיסות מתכת פזורות מסביב במה שנראה כמו אגפים קטנים של מחסן חלל ישן.,
002,7,The room bears a very metallic fragrance.,החדר אפוף בניחוח מאד מתכתי.,
002,8,The door was automatically sealed when the pod shut down shortly after your exit. It has served its purpose and will be of no further use.,הדלת נאטמה אוטומטית בעת שהחללית כיבתה את עצמה מיד לאחר צאתך. היא מילאה את ייעודה בעולם ולא יהיה בה שימוש בעתיד.,

002,16,"You notice that the sounds from the pod grow softer until they are imperceptible. Having served its purpose and taxed its resources, the pod gives a final hum and shuts down.","הבחנת כי הרעשים מהחללית הלכו ודעכו עד כי פסקו לגמרי. לאחר ששירתה את מטרתה ומילאה את חובתה, החללית השמיעה את זמזומה האחרון וכבתה לעד.",
002,17,Sensing an adequate surface the claw releases its cargo and begins the ascent to the grabber unit.,"הטופר מזהה את הקרקע, משחרר את המטען שלו ומתחיל לעשות את דרכו למעלה בחזרה אל יחידת הלוכד.",
002,18,"The claw senses contact with the warp motivator, grasps it firmly, and begins the ascent back to the grabber.","הטופר מזהה מגע עם מנוע הפיתול, אוחז בו בחוזקה ומתחיל לעשות את דרכו למעלה בחזרה אל יחידת הלוכד.",

Sturdily constructed, its only protrusion is a modular plug near its base.","זה נראה כמו מנוע הפיתול שראית במחשב המצב ב'ברוז האלומיניום'. במבנהו החסון, הבליטה היחידה בו היתה שקע מודולרי סמוך לבסיסו.","אולי עדיף לתרגם את מלארד ל'ברוז'?
אני חושב ש Aluminum Mallard = ""ברוז האלומיניום"". או משהו כזה..
הוספתי גם גרש מכל צד. רעיון דומה לאותיות הגדולות באנגלית - שיבינו שזה שם של משהו"
002,21,"A closer look at the object on the floor reveals that it is a warp motivator. It looks a bit more high-tech than the other junk strewn about this locale. Sturdily constructed, its only protrusion is a modular plug near its base.","מבט מקרוב על העצם המוטל על הקרקע גילה כי זהו מנוע פיתול. הוא נראה קצת יותר היי-טקי מאשר שאר הזבל שזרוע כאן באזור. במבנהו החסון, הבליטה היחידה בו היתה שקע מודולרי סמוך לבסיסו.",
002,22,The eight-pronged plug protrudes only slightly from the motivator's exterior.,התקע בעל שמונה הפינים בולט רק במעט מהחלק החיצוני של מנוע הפיתול.,
002,23,The floor is composed of a mosaic of overlapping welded steel plates. The menage of used metal plates appear to have been cut from a variety of sources. There is a small round object lying nearby.,הרצפה הורכבה מפסיפס של לוחות פלדה מרותכים. נראה כי שלישיית לוחיות המתכת נחתכו ממגוון מקורות. חפץ עגלגל קטן נח בקרבת מקום.,
002,24,You aren't capable of doing that.,אינך מסוגל לעשות זאת.,
002,25,"While relatively small, it seems to be quite dense. I think we're looking at a potential hernia if any attempts are made to manually relocate it.","למרות גודלו הזעיר, הוא נראה דחוס למדי. אני חושב שאנחנו מסתכנים בקילה אם ננסה להעבירו למקום אחר בכוחות עצמנו.",
002,26,You can't. It's permanently attached.,אתה לא יכול. הוא מחובר בחוזקה.,
003,0,"Bending aside a thin piece of scrap, you find an opening into another area and climb on in.","כשכופפת הצידה את פיסת המתכת הדקיקה, גילית כי מאחוריו נפתח פתח אל אזור אחר, והחלטת לטפס לעברו.",
003,1,This bulbous craft looks like it has seen a lot of action in its day. You believe it to be a bowtie fighter dating back to the cologne wars - a true relic.,נראה שהספינה העגלגלה ראתה ימים טובים יותר. אתה מעריך כי מדובר בחללית הפפיון המתוארכת לימי מלחמת המושבות - שריד מימי קדם.,

003,7,You can see down into the hole you once passed through. Nothing much can be seen from here.,אתה מביט מטה מבעד לחור שהרגע עברת דרכו. מכאן לא ניתן לראות הרבה.,
003,8,You can't from here.,אין אפשרות מכאן.,
003,9,The limited detail you make out through the ship's film-laden viewport is enough to convince you that everything of worth has been harvested.,המידע המועט שהצלחת לחלץ מבעד אשנב החללית הזעיר הספיק לך בשביל להבין שאם היה משהו בעל ערך הוא מזמן נשדד.,
003,10,The square object looks like an empty component cover for some craft. It covers nothing but deck now.,העצם המרובע נראה כמו חיפוי ריק של חללית כלשהי. כעת הוא לא חיפה דבר מלבד את הסיפון.,
003,11,You see nothing but riveted steel.,אינך רואה דבר מלבד פלדה ממוסמרת.,
003,12,Various types of abandoned spacecraft litter the floor of this intergalatic junkyard. All this place needs is a junk yard dog. You shiver at the thought.,סוגים שונים של רכבי חלל נטושים ריפדו את רצפת מגרש הגרוטאות הבין גלקטי. כל מה שחסר כאן זה כלב שמירה. צמרמורת חולפת בך מעצם המחשבה.,
003,13,"You can't do that, nor would it be helpful.","אינך יכול לעשות זאת, לא שזה היה עוזר.",
003,14,"Despite technological advances in strong, lightweight ship materials, you can't possibly budge it.","למרות ההתקדמות הטכנולוגית שחלה בפיתוח חומרי חלל חזקים וקלי משקל, אינך יכול פשוט לדחוף את זה.",

003,27,Ouch!,אאוץ'!,
003,28,It's not here to be gotten.,קצת קשה לקחת את מה שלא כאן.,"לא מבין את המשמעות
צביקה: אחרי שלוקחים את הסולם, ומנסים לקחת אותו שוב - כאשר הוא לא במקום, זו התשובה"
003,29,There is no ladder here.,אין כאן שום סולם.,
003,30,You ease your way into the hole.,אתה מפלס את דרכך אל עבר החור.,
003,31,"Unfortunately, the fall was too much for your frail frame to withstand.","לרוע המזל, הנפילה היתה קשה מדי עבור עצמותיך השבריריות.",
003,32,Sensing the floor the claw releases its cargo and begins the ascent to the grabber unit.,"הטופר מזהה את הקרקע, משחרר את המטען שלו ומתחיל לעשות את דרכו למעלה בחזרה אל יחידת הלוכד.",

003,35,YEOW!,יוווווו!,
003,36,"It's obvious that the metal was sharper than you. The resulting laceration turns you into a living fountain - at least for a few moments. Unfortunately for you, this show was your finale. Good luck in the afterlife.","מובן מאליו שהמתכת היתה חדה ממך. הקרע שנוצר הפך אותך למזרקה חיה - לפחות לכמה שניות. לרוע מזלך, ההופעה הזאת היתה פרק הסיום שלך. בהצלחה בעולם הבא.",
