1,1,"The pod, considered to be nothing more
than another piece of scrap, is taken
aboard a robot commanded garbage
freighter. Unfortunately these robots
have no regard for organics.",
2,0,Check again! It IS closed.,בדוק שנית! זה סגור.
2,1,This task is impossible since the door is sealed from the inside and there is no light emanating from within.,זאת משימה בלתי אפשרית משום שהדלת נעולה מבפנים ושום אור לא בוקע משם.
2,2,The window is clear enough to reveal the blackness inside.,החלון נקי מספיק בשביל לחשוף את החשיכה שבפנים.
2,3,The solidly built door looks to be locked in place.,הדלת המוצקה למראה נעולה על מנעול ובריח.
2,4,"The pod's thrusters are very small, designed for minimal attitude adjustments. They have been cold for a long time.","מנועי החללית קטנים מאד, מתוכננים לכיוונונים עדינים. נראה שהם כבר התקררו מזמן."
2,5,This is the escape pod which safely whisked you away from Vohaul's burning asteroid fortress. The skin of the pod plainly registers the cumulative damage long periods of space travel can inflict on a small craft such as this.,זהו תרמיל מילוט שנועד לשיגור בטוח ממצודת אסטרואידים בוערת בוואול. הנזקים המצטברים מנסיעות החלל הממושכות הותירו את רישומיהם על גבי מעטפת התרמיל.
2,6,You are standing in a debris-cluttered junk bay. An escape pod rests in the middle of the room. There are chunks of metal lying around which seem to be small sections of old spaceware.,אתה עומד על מסוף גרוטאות עמוס פסולת. תרמיל המילוט נח במרכז החדר. פיסות מתכת פזורות מסביב במה שנראה כמו אגפים קטנים של מחסן חלל ישן.
2,7,The room bears a very metallic fragrance.,החדר אפוף בניחוח מאד מתכתי.
2,8,The door was automatically sealed when the pod shut down shortly after your exit. It has served its purpose and will be of no further use.,הדלת נאטמה אוטומטית בעת שהתרמיל כיבה את עצמו מיד לאחר צאתך. הוא מילא את ייעודו בעולם ולא יהיה בו שימוש בעתיד.
2,9,"Despite technological advances in strong, lightweight ship materials, you can't possibly budge it.","למרות ההתקדמות הטכנולוגית שחלה בפיתוח חומרי חלל חזקים וקלי משקל, אינך יכול פשוט לדחוף את זה."
2,10,It's not available for your use.,הוא לא נועד לשימושך.
2,11,"If YOU could break the glass, it and you would not have survived the journey here.","אם היית יכול לנפץ את הזכוכית, הוא ואתה לא הייתם שורדים את המסע לכאן."

2,15,"Where Do You What To Start?
(Press ESC to Stay Here)","מהיכן תרצה להתחיל?
(לחץ על מקש ה-ESC על מנת להישאר כאן)"
2,16,"You notice that the sounds from the pod grow softer until they are imperceptible. Having served its purpose and taxed its resources, the pod gives a final hum and shuts down.","הבחנת כי הרעשים מהתרמיל הלכו ודעכו עד כי פסקו לגמרי. לאחר ששירת את מטרתו ומילא את חובתו, התרמיל השמיע את זמזומו האחרון וכבה לעד."
2,17,Sensing an adequate surface the claw releases its cargo and begins the ascent to the grabber unit.,בזהותה משטח הולם הצבת משחררת את מטענה ומתחילה בהעלאה על יחידת הגרירה.
2,18,"The claw senses contact with the warp motivator, grasps it firmly, and begins the ascent back to the grabber.","הצבת חשה במגע עם מניע המוטיבטור, אוחזת בו בחוזקה, ומחדשת את ההעלאה על גבי הגורר."
2,19,"Finding nothing here to carry, the claw begins the ascent to the grabber unit.","כשאינה מוצאת דבר לשאת, הצבת פותחת בהעלאה על גבי יחידת הגרירה."
2,20,"It looks like the warp motivator you saw on the Aluminum Mallard's Status Computer. Sturdily constructed, its only protrusion is a modular plug near its base.","זה נראה כמו מניע המוטיבטור שראית במחשב המצב באלומיניום מלארד. במבנהו החסון, הבליטה היחידה בו היתה שקע מודולרי סמוך לבסיסו."
2,21,"A closer look at the object on the floor reveals that it is a warp motivator. It looks a bit more high-tech than the other junk strewn about this locale. Sturdily constructed, its only protrusion is a modular plug near its base.","מבט מקרוב על העצם המוטל על הקרקע גילה כי זהו מניע המוטיבטור. הוא נראה יותר כמו הייטק מאשר עוד זבל שזרוע כאן באזור. במבנהו החסון, הבליטה היחידה בו היתה שקע מודולרי סמוך לבסיסו."
2,22,The eight-pronged plug protrudes only slightly from the motivator's exterior.,השקע המשונן בלט אך מעט ממעטהו החיצוני של המוטיבטור.
2,23,The floor is composed of a mosaic of overlapping welded steel plates. The menage of used metal plates appear to have been cut from a variety of sources. There is a small round object lying nearby.,הרצפה הורכבה מפסיפס של לוחות פלדה מרותכים. נראה כי שלישיית לוחיות המתכת נחתכו ממגוון מקורות. חפץ עגלגל קטן נח בקרבת מקום.
2,24,You aren't capable of doing that.,אינך מסוגל לעשות זאת.
2,25,"While relatively small, it seems to be quite dense. I think we're looking at a potential hernia if any attempts are made to manually relocate it.","למרות גודלו הזעיר, הוא נראה דחוס למדי. אני חושב שאנחנו מסתכנים בקילה אם ננסה להעבירו למקום אחר בכוחות עצמנו."
2,26,You can't. It's permanently attached.,אתה לא יכול. הוא מחובר בחוזקה.
3,0,"Bending aside a thin piece of scrap, you find an opening into another area and climb on in.",
3,1,This bulbous craft looks like it has seen a lot of action in its day. You believe it to be a bowtie fighter dating back to the cologne wars - a true relic.,
3,2,"This on is another fine, but worthless, Acme product.",
3,3,This ship says Jupiter 2. This baby must have been floating around out there for a long time. It doesn't hold your interest for very long.,
3,4,None are visible.,
3,5,It looks like your standard low-tech ascent/descent unit.,
3,6,It's not visible from here.,
3,7,You can see down into the hole you once passed through. Nothing much can be seen from here.,
3,8,You can't from here.,
3,9,The limited detail you make out through the ship's film-laden viewport is enough to convince you that everything of worth has been harvested.,
3,10,The square object looks like an empty component cover for some craft. It covers nothing but deck now.,
3,11,You see nothing but riveted steel.,
3,12,Various types of abandoned spacecraft litter the floor of this intergalatic junkyard. All this place needs is a junk yard dog. You shiver at the thought.,

3,15,You hear the faint sound of machinery in operation.,

3,21,You don't have it.,
3,22,Not from here.,
3,23,There is no ladder here to climb.,
3,24,There is nothing to climb into.,
3,25,That would be fruitless. Don't bother.,
3,26,You grab the ladder and jam it in your pocket.,
3,27,Ouch!,
3,28,It's not here to be gotten.,
3,29,There is no ladder here.,
3,30,You ease your way into the hole.,
3,31,"Unfortunately, the fall was too much for your frail frame to withstand.",
3,32,Sensing the floor the claw releases its cargo and begins the ascent to the grabber unit.,
3,33,"The claw senses contact with the warp motivator, grasps it firmly, and begins the ascent back to the grabber.",
3,34,Finding nothing here the claw begins to ascend to the grabber unit.,
3,35,YEOW!,

3,42,You aren't capable of doing that.,
3,43,You can't. It's permanently attached.,
3,44,This looks like some type of tunnel boring implement.,
3,45,"This ship is another fine, but worthless, Acme product.",
4,0,Buckets are attached to a conveyer. They haul metal debris to a horizontal conveyer above.,
4,1,You are overwhelmed by the variety of space trash around each corner. A large bucket conveyer carries shredded ships to a horizontal conveyer high above.,
4,2,Somewhere there's an oversized android missing a limb.,
4,3,It says Jupiter 2. This baby must have been floating around out there for a long time. It doesn't hold your interest for very long.,
4,4,"The viewport is too high. Besides, you'd not see anything interesting.",
4,5,None are visible.,
4,6,Hoooo boy! It's a big one.,
4,7,The item in question is just another piece in a fine collection of worthless junk carelessly splashed around the picture by the graphic artist. (You know who you are.),
4,8,You peer up and down the conveyer shaft. The view down is obstructed by the tight fit of the conveyer. The view up show it to lead to a horizontal conveyer above.,
4,9,That's not within your power.,
4,10,"You can't do that, nor would it be helpful.",
4,11,"Looks dangerous but go ahead, you thrill seeker, you. You'll need to get closer though.",
4,12,You are not skilled in ship climbing.,
4,13,"Despite technological advances in strong, lightweight ship materials, you can't possibly budge it.",
4,14,Sounds a little kinky. Maybe you should do that when no one else is around.,
4,15,"The item in question, which is just another piece in a fine collection of worthless junk carelessly splashed around the picture by the graphic artist, isn't needed by you.",
4,16,No.,

5,0,"It's quite dark in there, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel.",
5,1,"Not much remains. If there was anything of value, it was stripped away a long time ago.",
5,2,"It looks to be another metallic menace whose time has come and gone. Hopefully, fate will be kinder to you.",
5,3,Its metallic parts are frozen in place. I'll bet you're glad you weren't around when it was functional.,
5,4,You are quite impressed by the size of this junk freighter. The skeletal remains of a stripped-down space tanker stage lie half buried in scrap.,
5,5,It falls on non-existent ears.,
5,6,The gutted ship is unsafe for any such action.,
5,7,You don't fit,
5,8,You can't.,
5,9,Let the poor thing rest in peace. It can't help you anyway.,

5,19,Finding nothing here the claw begins to ascend to the grabber unit.,
6,0,You see another boring ceiling.,
6,1,The walls are made of metal. Missing panels reveal old frayed wires.,
6,2,One panel lies wedged against the wall. The other remaining panels are welded in place and are quite uninteresting in appearance.,
6,3,It's against the wall covering only more wall.,
6,4,You see another boring floor.,
6,5,Someone (or someTHING) has done a real job on this tanker. Was this the result of some space battle? Or perhaps you're not the only one roaming around in here.,
6,6,It looks to have survived better than its co-conductors.,
6,7,"Except for the one on the left, most of the wires here look dangerously worn.",
6,8,All the wires here look dangerously worn.,
6,9,You see nothing but darkness.,
6,10,"You only are able to see gray, furry blur. It looks like a rat.",
6,11,The fur-bearing pocket prober isn't currently present.,
6,12,Funny. I don't see that in this picture.,
6,13,You don't notice a hole.,
6,14,"The pipes are useless, as they are punctured in many places.",
6,15,There is nowhere for you to climb to.,
6,16,There are no decent wires within reach.,
6,17,There is no other wire here worthy of your acquisition.,
6,18,They're useless.,
6,19,You can't.,
6,20,The panel is of no use.,
6,21,You take the only decent piece of wire available.,
6,22,You seem to have been mugged by some type of large rat. As you pick loose fur from your teeth you notice a less bulky feeling.,
7,0,The gutted carcass of the tanker opens up to reveal even more junk. A metal head rests nearby.,
7,1,"It's quite dark in there, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel.",
7,2,"Not much remains. If there was anything of value, it was stripped away a long time ago.",
7,3,Wow! An ancient model of a Battlebot. I bet you'd hate to run into whatever brought this big guy down. It looks like something poked it in the eye.,
7,4,There are two eyes on the battlebot head. One of them has been broken.,
7,5,You can't see anything from down here.,
7,6,They're just small air ducts for the robot.,
7,7,The pyramid is nothing more than a dense metallic protrusion.,
7,8,The floor is composed of a mosaic of overlapping welded steel plates. The menage of used metal appears to have been cut from a variety of sources. The floor drops off near the large robot.,
7,9,The piles of scrap drop off here. It looks dark and dangerous down there.,
7,10,It isn't a ship. It's an ancient model of a Battlebot. I bet you'd hate to run into whatever brought this big guy down. It looks like something poked it in the eye.,
7,11,You can't from this location.,
7,12,"You're intellectual profile may be slim, but you still are too thick to enter that.",
7,13,"Whatever you say, Superman.",
7,14,Get closer.,
7,15,I don't think you're man enough!,
7,16,Sounds like you want to be doing something besides playing a dumb game.,
7,17,"You don't need to do that. Besides, one of them is already broken.",
7,18,"Oh, gosh! You've stepped off a metallic escarpment and tumbled into the darkness. Twisted, jagged remnants of old vehicles reach out to slow your dark descent, cutting short your life in the process.",
7,19,"It looks like the warp motivator you saw on the Aluminum Mallard's Status Computer. Sturdily constructed, its only protrusion is a modular plug near its base.",

7,28,Finding nothing here the claw begins to ascend to the grabber unit.,
8,0,"All of the metal has very jagged edges but is, otherwise, fairly ordinary.",
8,1,It looks like your basic hatch handle.,
8,2,You can't do that from down here.,
8,3,"It's a cute little thing. You've never seen anything like it in these parts, but then where are these parts? Some writing on its exterior reads `For a good time, don't call HAL!'",
8,4,"It's a cute little thing. You've never seen anything like it in these parts, but then where are these parts? Some writing on its exterior reads `Bowman was here.'",
8,5,It's a sleek-looking number if you can disregard the junk it's rooted in. It must be a recent addition to the collection as everything seems to be intact. Etched on each side is the name `ALUMINUM MALLARD'. On top is a small hatch.,
8,6,None are visible.,
8,7,You can't see them as they are buried in junk.,
8,8,You notice only the segmented spine-like neck of a former galactic menace.,
8,9,The hole in the pod is so small that you are unable to discern any interior features.,
8,10,You are at an unsuitable location for sucessfully viewing that.,
8,11,The blackness of the pod's interior is broken only by a small quantity of light pouring through a tiny meteoroid hole.,
8,12,You can make out a pilot's seat and a console. The aft end is dark.,
8,13,The angle makes it impossible to see any detail.,
8,14,You can't see anything like that from here.,
8,15,You peer into the compartment and see the ship's motivator unit resting snugly in its perch.,
8,16,You peer into the cavity in the top of the ship. The only noteworthy item is a modular plug in the bottom of the opening.,
8,17,You can't see it from here.,
8,18,You can't. It's covered by the warp motivator.,
8,19,It's the modular eight pin variety.,
8,20,You can't see it from down here.,
8,21,"They look like remnants of an orbital space station, or perhaps some type of toys for an over-sized child.",
8,22,It's a low-tech ascent/descent module.,
8,23,It looks like the small round passage that it is.,
8,24,There are none of those here.,
8,25,There is nothing interesting about them.,
8,26,You find yourself at the bottom of another trash pit. An interesting array of alien artifacts is strewn from one end to the other. A large ship is in the middle and a small one is off to one side.,
8,27,Get serious. We've got a game to play.,
8,28,"Despite technological advances in strong, lightweight ship materials, you can't possibly budge it.",
8,29,You can't. It's part of the ship.,
8,30,"Forget it. They're buried too deeply. Besides, you're too old to be playing with toys - at least you should be!",
8,31,You grab the ladder and jam it in your pocket.,
8,32,Ouch! (again),
8,33,You don't need it up here.,
8,34,That's not here to be gotten.,
8,35,Be more specific.,
8,36,I told you not to do that.,
8,37,It's too small for you.,
8,38,That won't help.,
8,39,That can't be done.,
8,40,Nothing is done with that here.,
8,41,That isn't necessary.,
8,42,Check again.,
8,43,You're wasting your time messing with this relic.,
8,44,It won't work here.,
8,45,You don't have that.,
8,46,That would be fruitless. Don't bother.,
8,47,You can't. It's closed permanently.,
8,48,I don't think there is much of you that could fit into the seriously snug aperture.,
8,49,Not with it down there.,
8,50,There is no ladder close enough to climb.,
8,51,There doesn't seem to be a ladder ready for scaling.,
8,52,That would be great. If only someone had been smart enough to bring a ladder.,
8,53,There is no good way to scale the slick ship.,
8,54,You're not in a good location for climbing that.,
8,55,That's not possible.,
8,56,The ship is too slick. You seem to remember an ectomorphic programmer friend telling you about ships with non-stick coatings for greater debris collision tolerance.,
8,57,"You can't do that, nor would it be helpful.",
8,58,We warned you to be careful. Did you listen? Nooooo! Good luck next time.,

66,10,It appears that parts of this planet's surface are not entirely stable.  Better be careful or you'll end up in that lava fondue below.,
69,0,There aren't any weapons here.,
69,1,The pirates are packing jello pistols.,

69,9,It's used for sending and receiving data.,
69,10,It's full of thermal detonators.,
69,11,From here it just looks like an old crate.,
69,12,You need to get real close and look in the little hole first.,
69,13,It looks like it's probably used for surveying and stuff like that.,
69,14,Piles of large volcanic rocks have accumulated here at the base of this volcano.,
69,15,Most of this stuff is too heavy for one person to carry.,
69,16,"Nah, it wouldn't do you any good.",
69,17,It's attached to your pole.,
69,18,It's attached firmly to the pole; it won't budge.,

75,19,"It wouldn't do any good to do that here.  Besides, you'll probably just blow your own foot off.",
75,20,The explosion disables the force field generator.  You may now travel safely to Pestulon.,
75,21,The explosion has shut off the beam that was shooting out from this thing.  Someone's gonna be really sore at you for this.,
80,0,"Seeing no immediate need to remain invisible, you turn off the belt.",

81,13,OK,
81,14,Where to Buddy?,
81,15,You make your way through the forest of strange trees to this clearing where you discover the entrance to some large underground complex. This must be ScumSoft. Suddenly the door to the complex begins to open.,
81,16,Several guards file out of the entrance and disperse into the woods. They must have been alerted to your presence when you landed. Two guards remain behind to watch the entrance.,
81,17,Decision Time. Do you wish to: ,
85,0,You now stand invisible before the entrance to ScumSoft. Two mean looking guards stand watch. They've no doubt been instructed to shoot anything that moves so don't waste any more time gawking.,
85,1,The guards are armed and alert.,
85,2,There are several force field generators creating an impenetrable barrier guarding the area behind the ScumSoft entrance. The force fields themselves are invisible until activated by an intruder.,
85,3,"Just use your eyes, ok?",
85,4,That would be very dangerous.,
85,5,I wouldn't mess with these guys if I were you.,
85,6,You have no way of doing that.,
85,7,Oh. No! You've stepped into an electrical force field and as a result you are fried to a crackly crunch. YOU'RE TOAST DUDE!,
85,8,What's happening??!!,
85,9,Uh Oh! The terminator's invisibility belt is losing power!,
86,0,You're within the outer fortifications of the ScumSoft headquarters. You see an elevator door and a button on the wall.,
86,1,It looks like an elevator entrance.,
86,2,There is a button on the wall next to the elevator door,
86,3,You nervously glance up to the top of the ramp knowing that the guards could come barreling down on you at any moment.,
86,4,There is a button on the wall by the elevator.,
86,5,The elevator door is tightly sealed.,
86,6,What's happening??!!,
86,7,"It looks like you've made it just in time, as your invisibility belt is now completely out of power.",
90,0,You find yourself in... Guess... A janitor's closet. You certainly have a sixth sense about this kind of thing.,
90,1,The door leads back into the hallway.,
90,2,That you did.,
90,3,"What a great idea, Roger! No one would be suspicious of a janitor walking around. You grab the coveralls and pull them on (seizing the opportune moment to dump all of the old items you've been pocketing along the way). What a great disguise! Wait... what's this?",
90,4,"You reach down into the pocket of the grimy coveralls and find... well, what do you know, Mr. Garbage! A trash vaporizer. You've seen these babies in all the janitorial supply catalogs but your superiors were always too cheap to outfit you with one.",
90,5,Just walk out.,
90,6,You are walking down a circular hallway... going %swhere.,
90,7,"You are in a hallway... somewhere deep in the innards of ScumSoft, Inc.",
90,8,You are entering an interminably long hallway.,
90,9,You are leaving the hallway.,
90,10,"Technically speaking, you're in a hallway.",
90,11,The door has a keycard security system as well as a composite facial scanner. It will be pretty tricky gaining access.,
90,12,A door leads out of the hallway.,
90,13,There's not a door in sight.,
90,14,"Second quessing yourself, you leave the `disguise' on.",
90,15,This is neither the time nor the place for that.,
90,16,'Using what?' you ask of yourself.,
90,17,Do that.,
90,18,A security system adjoins this door. There must be something worthwhile on the other side.,
90,19,Tampering with the security system can only lead to misfortune.,
90,20,This door is locked.,
90,21,Walk in front of a door if you want it to open.,
90,22,Don't worry about the doors; they'll take care of themselves.,
90,23,You are not near a locked door.,
90,24,Easier said than done without the proper keycard.,
90,25,These things take time...,
90,26,You're not facing a locked door.,
90,27,You need to get closer to the scanner.,
90,28,Do or don't; the fact remains the door is locked.,
90,29,The door is not an obstacle.,
90,30,Don't step on a crack!,
90,31,You've already found the vaporizer; the handkerchief is a permanent fixture.,
90,32,You haven't got any!,
90,33,You wouldn't be able to see where you were going.,
90,34,You don't have such.,
90,35,"Rummaging about the cramped closet you find a pair of old, grimy janitorial coveralls.",
90,36,"Your thorough search reveals a lot of used junk, but nothing of value to you.",
90,37,"You hear several clicks. ""I'm in"" you think to yourself.",

92,4,"There is a color copy machine which, oddly enough, is not currently under repair.",
92,5,You already did.,
92,6,It's not within your reach.,
92,7,That wouldn't fool anybody.,
92,8,"""Hello there"", you say to the nerd.",
92,9,"He asks ""Have you seen my pocket protector around here?""",
92,10,One copy per customer.,
92,11,It would help matters if you had an object suitable for copying.,
92,12,Get real.,
92,13,"Foolishly, you retake the picture of Elmo.",
92,14,"Surreptitiously, you snatch the picture of Elmo.",
92,15,"Wisely, you replace the original picture of Elmo.",
92,16,Make up your mind.,
92,17,"First making sure that no one is watching, you slip Elmo's picture into the copier and press the start button...",
92,18,Out pops a beautifully reproduced copy which you roll up and stash in your pocket.,
92,19,Don't forget the original!,
93,0,You are in the boss' cubicle area and the boss is in. Be reverent.,
93,1,You are in the boss' cubicle area and the boss is out. Be yourself.,
93,2,"Behind the desk sits a boy who looks to be about 14 years old. ""Do your job and get out"" he blurbs.",
93,3,Over the top of the partitions you can see two gentlemen cracking whips. You assume that it must be the programming department.,
93,4,Better keep your distance!,
93,5,"""Just do your job and scram"", he bellows in response.",
93,6,Your words fall on deaf ears.,
93,7,Don't be foolish!,
93,8,"All of the desk drawers are locked. However, someone has carelessly left a keycard on the desk.",
93,9,All of the desk drawers are locked.,
93,10,You're not in a position to do that.,
93,11,Not a wise choice at this time.,
93,12,You take the keycard.,
93,13,You're not near one.,
93,14,You already have the keycard.,
93,15,That is not available.,
94,0,You stand on a platform overlooking the Scum Soft vehicle bay.  In the center of the hangar sits your ship surrounded by rows of short-range skull fighters.  Now how will you ever get out of here?,
94,1,Your ship doesn't appear to have been tampered with.  You realize that it's only a matter of time before you are found as well.  Better get on to the business at hand: finding those Two Guys.,
94,2,"The short-range fighters are well armed and ready for action.  Even if you do manage to escape, they'll no doubt send these babies after you.",
94,3,The opened hangar doors reveal the Pestulonian sky above.,
94,4,Forget it!,
95,0,Looking down the deep shaft makes you giddy.,
95,1,The only visible means of access to the detention platform is by means of retractable bridges.,
95,2,Massive doors feed into the detention chamber from parts unknown.,
95,3,The lines warn you to watch your step!,
95,4,"Other than the tightly sealed doors, the walls reveal no exits.",
95,5,You notice several darkened observation windows high above. You hope no one is observing you now.,
95,6,An array of control buttons adjoins each door.,
95,7,Jesse Owens you ain't.,
95,8,There is not a button in your reach.,
95,9,"You cautiously enter a darkened chamber. A seemingly bottomless shaft drops off into a black abyss. On a platform in the center of the chamber, the Two Guys from Andromeda wiggle helplessly in lime jello. The platform can only be reached by the four retractable bridges at each entrance.",
95,10,'HELPH!' they slurp from their jello-encased captivity.,
95,11,Good idea! But how?,
95,12,This is not your ordinary store-bought jello.,
95,13,Think again.,
95,14,Yuck! You hate lime jello!,
95,15,"From where you stand, it couldn't be done.",
95,16,Horrors!,
95,17,The resilient jello resists your attempts.,
95,18,The jello exists no more.,
95,19,It's been vaporized into oblivion.,
95,20,It's a bit late for that now!,
95,21,Your puny vaporizer is ineffective.,
95,22,How now?,
95,23,Good news: you have freed the two guys from Andromeda!,
95,24,Bad news: you have been discovered meddling about.,

95,32,"""Roger Wilco,"" you admit.",
95,33,"""They discovered our distress message we coded into the Astro Chicken game and sent us here as punishment. Let's get out of here before we're discovered!""",

95,35,"Nobody's going anywhere... heh, heh, heh! You must have thought you were pretty clever, Mr. Wilco, disguising yourself as a janitor.",
95,36,"Unfortunately for you, my boys found your sorry excuse for a ship in the woods. Escort this gentleman to the ARENA. You boys haven't seen a good fight in quite a while.",

421,13,The large electric motor providing power for Mog's automation hums noisily away on the second level platform.,

501,0,It seems like this entire planet is one vast expanse of desert. About all you see is sand and rocks.,
501,1,"The ground beneath your feet is composed of an unusually colored sand. Other than it's bizzare coloration, you have no other interest in it. However... as you expectorate a mouthful of the wind blown sand you briefly reminisce about your adventure on Kerona (SQ I ).",
501,2,"There are sand dunes over most of Phleebhut. They hold no particular interest for you, except as an annoying obstacle to your progress.",
501,3,"The ground beneath your feet is composed of an unusually colored sand. Other than it's bizarre coloration, you have no other interest in it. However... as you expectorate a mouthful of the wind blown sand you briefly reminisce about your adventure on Kerona (SQ I ).",
501,4,You notice flashes of lightning to the north. You hope it doesn't move this way.,
501,5,The sky is alive with electrical activity as large ominous clouds make their way across the darkened sky.,
501,6,You see your feet.,
501,7,What a cute little scorpazoid! Perhaps you should pick it up and take it with you.,
501,8,You don't see one here.,
501,9,"A range of craggy peaks appear on the horizon far to the north. Occasionally, one is struck by lightning.",
501,10,Hmm. The footprints seem to be following you. I wonder who they could belong to.,
501,11,You don't see any here.,
501,12,The worn rocks seem to give evidence of millions of years of fierce sandstorms. Sure hope one of them doesn't come up while you're here.,
501,13,"Yes, those are clouds. I wonder if they contain water vapor, or some highly toxic substance such as ...",
501,14,The mountains are closer now.,
501,15,You don't see any reason to do that.,
501,16,"You don't see any reason to do that. Besides, most of them are too big to carry anyway.",
501,17,You'll have to get close enough first.,
501,18,"You can run, but you can't hide.",
501,19,You might chap your delicate hands since you don't have a shovel.,
501,20,You need to get close enough.,
501,21,That would serve no purpose.,
501,22,I don't think he's interested in talking.,

503,8,There he is!,
511,0,OH NO! A venomous scorpazoid. Watch out.,
511,1,The Scorpazoid's stinger hits it's mark sending electro-plasmatic venom into your system. Death comes quickly.,
600,0,Uh Oh!  That detonator has apparently set off a chain reaction of earthquakes.  You'd better get off this rock A.S.A.P.,
600,1,You find yourself at the base of a seemingly extinct volcano.,
600,2,You find yourself at the base of a seemingly extinct volcano.  There is a short range scout ship parked here.  But where is the pilot?,

600,8,The atmosphere has a definite red tint to it from the belching volcanoes and glowing lava.,
600,9,The sheer cliffs lead straight down to the searing lava below.  Watch your step.,
600,10,The ground is cracked by the constant heating and cooling of this unstable planet.,

600,29,You're not wearing any shorts.,
600,30,The sharp edges of the cooled lava would slice you to ribbons.  You decide against it.,
600,31,Too late you realize that walking around unprotected on this planet is hazardous to your health.  You feel your blood begin to boil.,
600,32,You sizzle into oblivion.  This planet wouldn't be so bad if you could keep cool somehow.,
690,0,"Hate to make you feel stupid, but you're already looking!",
690,1,"That's the moon, alright!  It's known around these parts as 'Pestulon'.",
690,2,"No more beam.  You broke it, remember?",
690,3,The force beam forms a protective energy shield around the moon.,
690,4,It looks like something from an old science fiction movie.,
690,5,There's nothing to get here.,
690,6,AHA!!!  You've discovered the force beam generator!   And that moon must be Pestulon.,
690,7,"What is that thing, anyway?  Whatever it is, you busted it real good.",
690,8,"What is that thing, anyway?  Maybe it's a TV transmitter, beaming game shows and championship wrestling to all corners of the globe.",

690,10,"Yep, that thing's still there.  But it's not beaming anymore since you broke it.",

700,1,I wouldn't mess with them. They look dangerous.,
700,2,"What a great way to die a slow and painful death. As appetizing as that sounds, you wisely opt against it.",

700,15,You won't be doing that here.,

700,17,It won't help you at this time.,
700,18,"You stare at the ceiling which, as usual, is overhead. You see nothing particularly unique about the structure except some kind of track running high above you. It seems to run the length of the freighter.",
700,19,The floor is composed of a mosaic of overlapping welded steel plates. The menage of used metal appears to have been cut from a variety of sources.,
700,20,They look like pieces of metal which have been welded together.,
700,21,Not much about it can be learned from down here.,
700,22,The walls are made of metal and very strong composite materials commonly used in spacecraft.,
700,23,The steep piles of scrap metal are chock-full of jagged edges and barbed protrusions.,
700,24,You'll find nothing ground-like in this synthetic environment.,

700,26,All available Light is being ported into the room via a series of vents in the ceiling.,
700,27,Strewn about are the totally gutted carcasses of many a formerly worthy craft.,
700,28,There are various useless plates of metal scattered about the ship. I wouldn't mess with them.,
700,29,A quick self-appraisal suggests that you are not horribly ugly. You guess you'd be a good catch.,
700,30,An inspection of yourself reveals nothing outstanding.,
700,31,Are you crazy? You've got adventuring to do.,
700,32,That won't help you now.,

700,40,Sorry. They're welded in place.,
700,41,You have no effect on the motivator.,
701,0,WARNING:  Short range fighters approaching from rear.  Weapons lock-on detected.,

701,2,"Having the correct shield up could have prevented this!   The final shot shreds the side of your ship.  In the sudden vacuum, your body fluids expand beyond the capacity of your tissues.  Your desicated body will drift forever, a grim testament to your blundering stupidity.",

702,1,Just another section in this maze of partitions.,
702,2,"The cabinet is locked (regardless, you wouldn't find anything useful).",
702,3,Everyone here looks related. It's like a secret society of nerds.,
702,4,Such a sight.,
702,5,Look but don't touch.,
702,6,Hardly an appropriate action for a janitor.,

702,12,Oops! You missed.,
702,13,William Tell you are not.,
702,14,Stand closer -- it's shorter than you think.,
702,15,You just put a nasty burn mark in the carpet.,
702,16,You're starting to arouse suspicion with your marksmanship.,
702,17,That didn't accomplish much.,

703,13,It won't help you at this time.,
703,14,You'd do more harm than good.,
703,15,You would be unwise.,

703,17,Looking down makes you dizzy.,
703,18,An inspection of yourself reveals nothing outstanding.,
703,19,It's way down there and not very pretty.,
